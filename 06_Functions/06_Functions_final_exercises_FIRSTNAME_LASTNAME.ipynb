Define a function `legomena` that given the filename of a text will return a list of all its hapax legomena. Make sure your program ignores capitalization as well as punctuation (hint: check out `string.punctuation` online!). Try out the function on your Gutenberg book from the previous Chapter. For simplicity, make sure your Gutenberg file is in the same directory as your hapax script, so that you can just use the file's name as a relative path. Alternatively, you can use an absolute path to the file."

This is called *code refactoring*: splitting multi-step functionality over several functions. This is good practice, and will make the next exercise much easier."
