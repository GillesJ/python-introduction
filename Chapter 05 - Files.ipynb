    "Text files are written to disk using 0s and 1s. As a result, computers need a way of converting between letters and bits. This is done using a *character set* or *encoding*: a mapping table that maps a set of characters to a binary representation. Most character sets use 8 bits (1 byte) for encoding a character. 8 bits provide 2 to the power of 8 possible combinations (256), so a typical character set can only represent 256 different characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the heyday of computers, English was the language of choice. The typical English characters were encoded using the first 128 bit combinations (a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9, punctuation marks etc). This became a standard, known as the ASCII character set. Later, computer manufacturers started filling up the remaining 128 combinations to allow for characters with accents, Greek and Cyrillic characters, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "There were two problems, however. First, there is no easy way of telling which character set a plain text file is encoded in. If someone on a Greek computer sent a text file to someone in France, any character not in the ASCII set would look wrong on the French end. You can still see this sometimes when you use special characters in web forms that do not take into account encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem is that there were no standards for encoding non-ASCII characters: every manufacturer just made up encodings as needed. This changed with the Unicode standardization effort. It describes every possible character in any script, and allows encodings to be mapped to it. Using Unicode as an interlingua, we can now translate between encodings, as long as the characters to be translated exist in both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses Unicode internally. Any text it receives is translated (*decoded*) into Unicode (e.g. using the computer's default encoding). When it writes out to a file (or to your screen), it again *encodes* the Unicode characters using a specified (or the system's default) encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, UTF-8 should be your character encoding of choice. It allows to encode any Unicode character, and uses as few bytes as possible to do that. Always using UTF-8 has the advantage that you never have to guess which character encoding you used, and that no matter which characters appear in your text, UTF-8 will be able to represent them."
