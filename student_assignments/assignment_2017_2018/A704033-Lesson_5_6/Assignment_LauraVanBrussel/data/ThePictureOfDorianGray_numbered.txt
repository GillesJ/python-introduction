26  THE PREFACE
27  
28  The artist is the creator of beautiful things.  To reveal art and
29  conceal the artist is art's aim.  The critic is he who can translate
30  into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful
31  things.
32  
33  The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.
34  Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without
35  being charming.  This is a fault.
36  
37  Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the
38  cultivated.  For these there is hope.  They are the elect to whom
39  beautiful things mean only beauty.
40  
41  There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book.  Books are well
42  written, or badly written.  That is all.
43  
44  The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing
45  his own face in a glass.
46  
47  The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban
48  not seeing his own face in a glass.  The moral life of man forms part
49  of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists
50  in the perfect use of an imperfect medium.  No artist desires to prove
51  anything.  Even things that are true can be proved.  No artist has
52  ethical sympathies.  An ethical sympathy in an artist is an
53  unpardonable mannerism of style.  No artist is ever morbid.  The artist
54  can express everything.  Thought and language are to the artist
55  instruments of an art.  Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for
56  an art.  From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is
57  the art of the musician.  From the point of view of feeling, the
58  actor's craft is the type.  All art is at once surface and symbol.
59  Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril.  Those who read
60  the symbol do so at their peril.  It is the spectator, and not life,
61  that art really mirrors.  Diversity of opinion about a work of art
62  shows that the work is new, complex, and vital.  When critics disagree,
63  the artist is in accord with himself.  We can forgive a man for making
64  a useful thing as long as he does not admire it.  The only excuse for
65  making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.
66  
67                 All art is quite useless.

74  CHAPTER 1
75  
76  The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light
77  summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through
78  the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate
79  perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.
80  
81  From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was
82  lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry
83  Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured
84  blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to
85  bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then
86  the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long
87  tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,
88  producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of
89  those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of
90  an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of
91  swiftness and motion.  The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their
92  way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous
93  insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,
94  seemed to make the stillness more oppressive.  The dim roar of London
95  was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.
96  
97  In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the
98  full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,
99  and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist
100  himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago
101  caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many
102  strange conjectures.
103  
104  As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so
105  skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his
106  face, and seemed about to linger there.  But he suddenly started up,
107  and closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he
108  sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he
109  feared he might awake.
110  
111  "It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done," said
112  Lord Henry languidly.  "You must certainly send it next year to the
113  Grosvenor.  The Academy is too large and too vulgar.  Whenever I have
114  gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been
115  able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that
116  I have not been able to see the people, which was worse.  The Grosvenor
117  is really the only place."
118  
119  "I don't think I shall send it anywhere," he answered, tossing his head
120  back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at
121  Oxford.  "No, I won't send it anywhere."
122  
123  Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through
124  the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls
125  from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette.  "Not send it anywhere?  My
126  dear fellow, why?  Have you any reason?  What odd chaps you painters
127  are!  You do anything in the world to gain a reputation.  As soon as
128  you have one, you seem to want to throw it away.  It is silly of you,
129  for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about,
130  and that is not being talked about.  A portrait like this would set you
131  far above all the young men in England, and make the old men quite
132  jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion."
133  
134  "I know you will laugh at me," he replied, "but I really can't exhibit
135  it.  I have put too much of myself into it."
136  
137  Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.
138  
139  "Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same."
140  
141  "Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you
142  were so vain; and I really can't see any resemblance between you, with
143  your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young
144  Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why,
145  my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you--well, of course you have an
146  intellectual expression and all that.  But beauty, real beauty, ends
147  where an intellectual expression begins.  Intellect is in itself a mode
148  of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face.  The moment one
149  sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something
150  horrid.  Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.
151  How perfectly hideous they are!  Except, of course, in the Church.  But
152  then in the Church they don't think.  A bishop keeps on saying at the
153  age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,
154  and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.
155  Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but
156  whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks.  I feel quite sure of
157  that.  He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always
158  here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in
159  summer when we want something to chill our intelligence.  Don't flatter
160  yourself, Basil:  you are not in the least like him."
161  
162  "You don't understand me, Harry," answered the artist.  "Of course I am
163  not like him.  I know that perfectly well.  Indeed, I should be sorry
164  to look like him.  You shrug your shoulders?  I am telling you the
165  truth.  There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual
166  distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the
167  faltering steps of kings.  It is better not to be different from one's
168  fellows.  The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world.
169  They can sit at their ease and gape at the play.  If they know nothing
170  of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat.  They
171  live as we all should live--undisturbed, indifferent, and without
172  disquiet.  They neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it
173  from alien hands.  Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they
174  are--my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray's good looks--we
175  shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly."
176  
177  "Dorian Gray?  Is that his name?" asked Lord Henry, walking across the
178  studio towards Basil Hallward.
179  
180  "Yes, that is his name.  I didn't intend to tell it to you."
181  
182  "But why not?"
183  
184  "Oh, I can't explain.  When I like people immensely, I never tell their
185  names to any one.  It is like surrendering a part of them.  I have
186  grown to love secrecy.  It seems to be the one thing that can make
187  modern life mysterious or marvellous to us.  The commonest thing is
188  delightful if one only hides it.  When I leave town now I never tell my
189  people where I am going.  If I did, I would lose all my pleasure.  It
190  is a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great
191  deal of romance into one's life.  I suppose you think me awfully
192  foolish about it?"
193  
194  "Not at all," answered Lord Henry, "not at all, my dear Basil.  You
195  seem to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that
196  it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties.  I
197  never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.
198  When we meet--we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go
199  down to the Duke's--we tell each other the most absurd stories with the
200  most serious faces.  My wife is very good at it--much better, in fact,
201  than I am.  She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do.
202  But when she does find me out, she makes no row at all.  I sometimes
203  wish she would; but she merely laughs at me."
204  
205  "I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry," said Basil
206  Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden.  "I
207  believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are
208  thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues.  You are an extraordinary
209  fellow.  You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.
210  Your cynicism is simply a pose."
211  
212  "Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,"
213  cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the
214  garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that
215  stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush.  The sunlight slipped over
216  the polished leaves.  In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.
217  
218  After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch.  "I am afraid I must be
219  going, Basil," he murmured, "and before I go, I insist on your
220  answering a question I put to you some time ago."
221  
222  "What is that?" said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.
223  
224  "You know quite well."
225  
226  "I do not, Harry."
227  
228  "Well, I will tell you what it is.  I want you to explain to me why you
229  won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture.  I want the real reason."
230  
231  "I told you the real reason."
232  
233  "No, you did not.  You said it was because there was too much of
234  yourself in it.  Now, that is childish."
235  
236  "Harry," said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, "every
237  portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not
238  of the sitter.  The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion.  It is
239  not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on
240  the coloured canvas, reveals himself.  The reason I will not exhibit
241  this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of
242  my own soul."
243  
244  Lord Henry laughed.  "And what is that?" he asked.
245  
246  "I will tell you," said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came
247  over his face.
248  
249  "I am all expectation, Basil," continued his companion, glancing at him.
250  
251  "Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry," answered the painter;
252  "and I am afraid you will hardly understand it.  Perhaps you will
253  hardly believe it."
254  
255  Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from
256  the grass and examined it.  "I am quite sure I shall understand it," he
257  replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,
258  "and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it
259  is quite incredible."
260  
261  The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy
262  lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the
263  languid air.  A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a
264  blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze
265  wings.  Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward's heart
266  beating, and wondered what was coming.
267  
268  "The story is simply this," said the painter after some time.  "Two
269  months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon's. You know we poor
270  artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to
271  remind the public that we are not savages.  With an evening coat and a
272  white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain
273  a reputation for being civilized.  Well, after I had been in the room
274  about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious
275  academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at
276  me.  I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.
277  When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale.  A curious sensation
278  of terror came over me.  I knew that I had come face to face with some
279  one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to
280  do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art
281  itself.  I did not want any external influence in my life.  You know
282  yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature.  I have always been my
283  own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.
284  Then--but I don't know how to explain it to you.  Something seemed to
285  tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life.  I had
286  a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and
287  exquisite sorrows.  I grew afraid and turned to quit the room.  It was
288  not conscience that made me do so:  it was a sort of cowardice.  I take
289  no credit to myself for trying to escape."
290  
291  "Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil.
292  Conscience is the trade-name of the firm.  That is all."
293  
294  "I don't believe that, Harry, and I don't believe you do either.
295  However, whatever was my motive--and it may have been pride, for I used
296  to be very proud--I certainly struggled to the door.  There, of course,
297  I stumbled against Lady Brandon.  'You are not going to run away so
298  soon, Mr. Hallward?' she screamed out.  You know her curiously shrill
299  voice?"
300  
301  "Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty," said Lord Henry,
302  pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.
303  
304  "I could not get rid of her.  She brought me up to royalties, and
305  people with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras
306  and parrot noses.  She spoke of me as her dearest friend.  I had only
307  met her once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me.  I
308  believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at
309  least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the
310  nineteenth-century standard of immortality.  Suddenly I found myself
311  face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely
312  stirred me.  We were quite close, almost touching.  Our eyes met again.
313  It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.
314  Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all.  It was simply inevitable.
315  We would have spoken to each other without any introduction.  I am sure
316  of that.  Dorian told me so afterwards.  He, too, felt that we were
317  destined to know each other."
318  
319  "And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?" asked his
320  companion.  "I know she goes in for giving a rapid _precis_ of all her
321  guests.  I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old
322  gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my
323  ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to
324  everybody in the room, the most astounding details.  I simply fled.  I
325  like to find out people for myself.  But Lady Brandon treats her guests
326  exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods.  She either explains them
327  entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants
328  to know."
329  
330  "Poor Lady Brandon!  You are hard on her, Harry!" said Hallward
331  listlessly.
332  
333  "My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in
334  opening a restaurant.  How could I admire her?  But tell me, what did
335  she say about Mr. Dorian Gray?"
336  
337  "Oh, something like, 'Charming boy--poor dear mother and I absolutely
338  inseparable.  Quite forget what he does--afraid he--doesn't do
339  anything--oh, yes, plays the piano--or is it the violin, dear Mr.
340  Gray?'  Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at
341  once."
342  
343  "Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far
344  the best ending for one," said the young lord, plucking another daisy.
345  
346  Hallward shook his head.  "You don't understand what friendship is,
347  Harry," he murmured--"or what enmity is, for that matter.  You like
348  every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one."
349  
350  "How horribly unjust of you!" cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back
351  and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of
352  glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the
353  summer sky.  "Yes; horribly unjust of you.  I make a great difference
354  between people.  I choose my friends for their good looks, my
355  acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good
356  intellects.  A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.
357  I have not got one who is a fool.  They are all men of some
358  intellectual power, and consequently they all appreciate me.  Is that
359  very vain of me?  I think it is rather vain."
360  
361  "I should think it was, Harry.  But according to your category I must
362  be merely an acquaintance."
363  
364  "My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance."
365  
366  "And much less than a friend.  A sort of brother, I suppose?"
367  
368  "Oh, brothers!  I don't care for brothers.  My elder brother won't die,
369  and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else."
370  
371  "Harry!" exclaimed Hallward, frowning.
372  
373  "My dear fellow, I am not quite serious.  But I can't help detesting my
374  relations.  I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand
375  other people having the same faults as ourselves.  I quite sympathize
376  with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices
377  of the upper orders.  The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and
378  immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of
379  us makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves.  When
380  poor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite
381  magnificent.  And yet I don't suppose that ten per cent of the
382  proletariat live correctly."
383  
384  "I don't agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is
385  more, Harry, I feel sure you don't either."
386  
387  Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his
388  patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane.  "How English you are
389  Basil!  That is the second time you have made that observation.  If one
390  puts forward an idea to a true Englishman--always a rash thing to
391  do--he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong.
392  The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes
393  it oneself.  Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do
394  with the sincerity of the man who expresses it.  Indeed, the
395  probabilities are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely
396  intellectual will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured
397  by either his wants, his desires, or his prejudices.  However, I don't
398  propose to discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you.  I
399  like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no
400  principles better than anything else in the world.  Tell me more about
401  Mr. Dorian Gray.  How often do you see him?"
402  
403  "Every day.  I couldn't be happy if I didn't see him every day.  He is
404  absolutely necessary to me."
405  
406  "How extraordinary!  I thought you would never care for anything but
407  your art."
408  
409  "He is all my art to me now," said the painter gravely.  "I sometimes
410  think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the
411  world's history.  The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,
412  and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.
413  What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of
414  Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will
415  some day be to me.  It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from
416  him, sketch from him.  Of course, I have done all that.  But he is much
417  more to me than a model or a sitter.  I won't tell you that I am
418  dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such
419  that art cannot express it.  There is nothing that art cannot express,
420  and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good
421  work, is the best work of my life.  But in some curious way--I wonder
422  will you understand me?--his personality has suggested to me an
423  entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style.  I see
424  things differently, I think of them differently.  I can now recreate
425  life in a way that was hidden from me before.  'A dream of form in days
426  of thought'--who is it who says that?  I forget; but it is what Dorian
427  Gray has been to me.  The merely visible presence of this lad--for he
428  seems to me little more than a lad, though he is really over
429  twenty--his merely visible presence--ah!  I wonder can you realize all
430  that that means?  Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh
431  school, a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic
432  spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek.  The harmony of
433  soul and body--how much that is!  We in our madness have separated the
434  two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is
435  void.  Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me!  You remember
436  that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price
437  but which I would not part with?  It is one of the best things I have
438  ever done.  And why is it so?  Because, while I was painting it, Dorian
439  Gray sat beside me.  Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and
440  for the first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I
441  had always looked for and always missed."
442  
443  "Basil, this is extraordinary!  I must see Dorian Gray."
444  
445  Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden.  After
446  some time he came back.  "Harry," he said, "Dorian Gray is to me simply
447  a motive in art.  You might see nothing in him.  I see everything in
448  him.  He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is
449  there.  He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner.  I find
450  him in the curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of
451  certain colours.  That is all."
452  
453  "Then why won't you exhibit his portrait?" asked Lord Henry.
454  
455  "Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of
456  all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never
457  cared to speak to him.  He knows nothing about it.  He shall never know
458  anything about it.  But the world might guess it, and I will not bare
459  my soul to their shallow prying eyes.  My heart shall never be put
460  under their microscope.  There is too much of myself in the thing,
461  Harry--too much of myself!"
462  
463  "Poets are not so scrupulous as you are.  They know how useful passion
464  is for publication.  Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions."
465  
466  "I hate them for it," cried Hallward.  "An artist should create
467  beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.  We
468  live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of
469  autobiography.  We have lost the abstract sense of beauty.  Some day I
470  will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall
471  never see my portrait of Dorian Gray."
472  
473  "I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won't argue with you.  It is only
474  the intellectually lost who ever argue.  Tell me, is Dorian Gray very
475  fond of you?"
476  
477  The painter considered for a few moments.  "He likes me," he answered
478  after a pause; "I know he likes me.  Of course I flatter him
479  dreadfully.  I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I
480  know I shall be sorry for having said.  As a rule, he is charming to
481  me, and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things.  Now and
482  then, however, he is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real
483  delight in giving me pain.  Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away
484  my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put
485  in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a
486  summer's day."
487  
488  "Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger," murmured Lord Henry.
489  "Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will.  It is a sad thing to think
490  of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty.  That
491  accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate
492  ourselves.  In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have
493  something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and
494  facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place.  The thoroughly
495  well-informed man--that is the modern ideal.  And the mind of the
496  thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing.  It is like a
497  _bric-a-brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above
498  its proper value.  I think you will tire first, all the same.  Some day
499  you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little
500  out of drawing, or you won't like his tone of colour, or something.
501  You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think
502  that he has behaved very badly to you.  The next time he calls, you
503  will be perfectly cold and indifferent.  It will be a great pity, for
504  it will alter you.  What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance
505  of art one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind
506  is that it leaves one so unromantic."
507  
508  "Harry, don't talk like that.  As long as I live, the personality of
509  Dorian Gray will dominate me.  You can't feel what I feel.  You change
510  too often."
511  
512  "Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it.  Those who are
513  faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who
514  know love's tragedies."  And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty
515  silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and
516  satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase.  There was
517  a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy,
518  and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like
519  swallows.  How pleasant it was in the garden!  And how delightful other
520  people's emotions were!--much more delightful than their ideas, it
521  seemed to him.  One's own soul, and the passions of one's
522  friends--those were the fascinating things in life.  He pictured to
523  himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed
524  by staying so long with Basil Hallward.  Had he gone to his aunt's, he
525  would have been sure to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole
526  conversation would have been about the feeding of the poor and the
527  necessity for model lodging-houses. Each class would have preached the
528  importance of those virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity
529  in their own lives.  The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift,
530  and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour.  It was
531  charming to have escaped all that!  As he thought of his aunt, an idea
532  seemed to strike him.  He turned to Hallward and said, "My dear fellow,
533  I have just remembered."
534  
535  "Remembered what, Harry?"
536  
537  "Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray."
538  
539  "Where was it?" asked Hallward, with a slight frown.
540  
541  "Don't look so angry, Basil.  It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha's.  She
542  told me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help
543  her in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray.  I am bound to
544  state that she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no
545  appreciation of good looks; at least, good women have not.  She said
546  that he was very earnest and had a beautiful nature.  I at once
547  pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly
548  freckled, and tramping about on huge feet.  I wish I had known it was
549  your friend."
550  
551  "I am very glad you didn't, Harry."
552  
553  "Why?"
554  
555  "I don't want you to meet him."
556  
557  "You don't want me to meet him?"
558  
559  "No."
560  
561  "Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir," said the butler, coming into
562  the garden.
563  
564  "You must introduce me now," cried Lord Henry, laughing.
565  
566  The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.
567  "Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker:  I shall be in in a few moments." The
568  man bowed and went up the walk.
569  
570  Then he looked at Lord Henry.  "Dorian Gray is my dearest friend," he
571  said.  "He has a simple and a beautiful nature.  Your aunt was quite
572  right in what she said of him.  Don't spoil him.  Don't try to
573  influence him.  Your influence would be bad.  The world is wide, and
574  has many marvellous people in it.  Don't take away from me the one
575  person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses:  my life as an
576  artist depends on him.  Mind, Harry, I trust you."  He spoke very
577  slowly, and the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.
578  
579  "What nonsense you talk!" said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward
580  by the arm, he almost led him into the house.
581  
582  
583  
584  CHAPTER 2
585  
586  As they entered they saw Dorian Gray.  He was seated at the piano, with
587  his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann's
588  "Forest Scenes."  "You must lend me these, Basil," he cried.  "I want
589  to learn them.  They are perfectly charming."
590  
591  "That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian."
592  
593  "Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don't want a life-sized portrait of
594  myself," answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a
595  wilful, petulant manner.  When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint
596  blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up.  "I beg your
597  pardon, Basil, but I didn't know you had any one with you."
598  
599  "This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine.  I
600  have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you
601  have spoiled everything."
602  
603  "You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray," said Lord
604  Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand.  "My aunt has often
605  spoken to me about you.  You are one of her favourites, and, I am
606  afraid, one of her victims also."
607  
608  "I am in Lady Agatha's black books at present," answered Dorian with a
609  funny look of penitence.  "I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel
610  with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it.  We were to
611  have played a duet together--three duets, I believe.  I don't know what
612  she will say to me.  I am far too frightened to call."
613  
614  "Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt.  She is quite devoted to you.
615  And I don't think it really matters about your not being there.  The
616  audience probably thought it was a duet.  When Aunt Agatha sits down to
617  the piano, she makes quite enough noise for two people."
618  
619  "That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me," answered Dorian,
620  laughing.
621  
622  Lord Henry looked at him.  Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome,
623  with his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp
624  gold hair.  There was something in his face that made one trust him at
625  once.  All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth's
626  passionate purity.  One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from
627  the world.  No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.
628  
629  "You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray--far too
630  charming." And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened
631  his cigarette-case.
632  
633  The painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes
634  ready.  He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry's last
635  remark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said,
636  "Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it
637  awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?"
638  
639  Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray.  "Am I to go, Mr. Gray?"
640  he asked.
641  
642  "Oh, please don't, Lord Henry.  I see that Basil is in one of his sulky
643  moods, and I can't bear him when he sulks.  Besides, I want you to tell
644  me why I should not go in for philanthropy."
645  
646  "I don't know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray.  It is so tedious a
647  subject that one would have to talk seriously about it.  But I
648  certainly shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop.  You
649  don't really mind, Basil, do you?  You have often told me that you
650  liked your sitters to have some one to chat to."
651  
652  Hallward bit his lip.  "If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.
653  Dorian's whims are laws to everybody, except himself."
654  
655  Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves.  "You are very pressing, Basil,
656  but I am afraid I must go.  I have promised to meet a man at the
657  Orleans.  Good-bye, Mr. Gray.  Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon
658  Street.  I am nearly always at home at five o'clock. Write to me when
659  you are coming.  I should be sorry to miss you."
660  
661  "Basil," cried Dorian Gray, "if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go,
662  too.  You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is
663  horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant.  Ask
664  him to stay.  I insist upon it."
665  
666  "Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me," said Hallward,
667  gazing intently at his picture.  "It is quite true, I never talk when I
668  am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious
669  for my unfortunate sitters.  I beg you to stay."
670  
671  "But what about my man at the Orleans?"
672  
673  The painter laughed.  "I don't think there will be any difficulty about
674  that.  Sit down again, Harry.  And now, Dorian, get up on the platform,
675  and don't move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry
676  says.  He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the
677  single exception of myself."
678  
679  Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek
680  martyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom he
681  had rather taken a fancy.  He was so unlike Basil.  They made a
682  delightful contrast.  And he had such a beautiful voice.  After a few
683  moments he said to him, "Have you really a very bad influence, Lord
684  Henry?  As bad as Basil says?"
685  
686  "There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray.  All influence
687  is immoral--immoral from the scientific point of view."
688  
689  "Why?"
690  
691  "Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul.  He does
692  not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions.  His
693  virtues are not real to him.  His sins, if there are such things as
694  sins, are borrowed.  He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an
695  actor of a part that has not been written for him.  The aim of life is
696  self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly--that is what each
697  of us is here for.  People are afraid of themselves, nowadays.  They
698  have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to
699  one's self.  Of course, they are charitable.  They feed the hungry and
700  clothe the beggar.  But their own souls starve, and are naked.  Courage
701  has gone out of our race.  Perhaps we never really had it.  The terror
702  of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is
703  the secret of religion--these are the two things that govern us.  And
704  yet--"
705  
706  "Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good
707  boy," said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look
708  had come into the lad's face that he had never seen there before.
709  
710  "And yet," continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with
711  that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of
712  him, and that he had even in his Eton days, "I believe that if one man
713  were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to
714  every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream--I
715  believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we
716  would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the
717  Hellenic ideal--to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it
718  may be.  But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself.  The
719  mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial
720  that mars our lives.  We are punished for our refusals.  Every impulse
721  that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us.  The body
722  sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of
723  purification.  Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure,
724  or the luxury of a regret.  The only way to get rid of a temptation is
725  to yield to it.  Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for
726  the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its
727  monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.  It has been said that
728  the great events of the world take place in the brain.  It is in the
729  brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place
730  also.  You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your
731  rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid,
732  thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping
733  dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame--"
734  
735  "Stop!" faltered Dorian Gray, "stop! you bewilder me.  I don't know
736  what to say.  There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it.  Don't
737  speak.  Let me think.  Or, rather, let me try not to think."
738  
739  For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and
740  eyes strangely bright.  He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh
741  influences were at work within him.  Yet they seemed to him to have
742  come really from himself.  The few words that Basil's friend had said
743  to him--words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in
744  them--had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before,
745  but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.
746  
747  Music had stirred him like that.  Music had troubled him many times.
748  But music was not articulate.  It was not a new world, but rather
749  another chaos, that it created in us.  Words!  Mere words!  How
750  terrible they were!  How clear, and vivid, and cruel!  One could not
751  escape from them.  And yet what a subtle magic there was in them!  They
752  seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to
753  have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute.  Mere
754  words!  Was there anything so real as words?
755  
756  Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.
757  He understood them now.  Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him.
758  It seemed to him that he had been walking in fire.  Why had he not
759  known it?
760  
761  With his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him.  He knew the precise
762  psychological moment when to say nothing.  He felt intensely
763  interested.  He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had
764  produced, and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen,
765  a book which had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he
766  wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.
767  He had merely shot an arrow into the air.  Had it hit the mark?  How
768  fascinating the lad was!
769  
770  Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had
771  the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes
772  only from strength.  He was unconscious of the silence.
773  
774  "Basil, I am tired of standing," cried Dorian Gray suddenly.  "I must
775  go out and sit in the garden.  The air is stifling here."
776  
777  "My dear fellow, I am so sorry.  When I am painting, I can't think of
778  anything else.  But you never sat better.  You were perfectly still.
779  And I have caught the effect I wanted--the half-parted lips and the
780  bright look in the eyes.  I don't know what Harry has been saying to
781  you, but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression.
782  I suppose he has been paying you compliments.  You mustn't believe a
783  word that he says."
784  
785  "He has certainly not been paying me compliments.  Perhaps that is the
786  reason that I don't believe anything he has told me."
787  
788  "You know you believe it all," said Lord Henry, looking at him with his
789  dreamy languorous eyes.  "I will go out to the garden with you.  It is
790  horribly hot in the studio.  Basil, let us have something iced to
791  drink, something with strawberries in it."
792  
793  "Certainly, Harry.  Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will
794  tell him what you want.  I have got to work up this background, so I
795  will join you later on.  Don't keep Dorian too long.  I have never been
796  in better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my
797  masterpiece.  It is my masterpiece as it stands."
798  
799  Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his
800  face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their
801  perfume as if it had been wine.  He came close to him and put his hand
802  upon his shoulder.  "You are quite right to do that," he murmured.
803  "Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the
804  senses but the soul."
805  
806  The lad started and drew back.  He was bareheaded, and the leaves had
807  tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads.
808  There was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are
809  suddenly awakened.  His finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some
810  hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.
811  
812  "Yes," continued Lord Henry, "that is one of the great secrets of
813  life--to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means
814  of the soul.  You are a wonderful creation.  You know more than you
815  think you know, just as you know less than you want to know."
816  
817  Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away.  He could not help liking
818  the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him.  His romantic,
819  olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him.  There was
820  something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating.
821  His cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm.  They
822  moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their
823  own.  But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid.  Why had
824  it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself?  He had known
825  Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never
826  altered him.  Suddenly there had come some one across his life who
827  seemed to have disclosed to him life's mystery.  And, yet, what was
828  there to be afraid of?  He was not a schoolboy or a girl.  It was
829  absurd to be frightened.
830  
831  "Let us go and sit in the shade," said Lord Henry.  "Parker has brought
832  out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be
833  quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again.  You really must
834  not allow yourself to become sunburnt.  It would be unbecoming."
835  
836  "What can it matter?" cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on
837  the seat at the end of the garden.
838  
839  "It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray."
840  
841  "Why?"
842  
843  "Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing
844  worth having."
845  
846  "I don't feel that, Lord Henry."
847  
848  "No, you don't feel it now.  Some day, when you are old and wrinkled
849  and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and
850  passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you
851  will feel it terribly.  Now, wherever you go, you charm the world.
852  Will it always be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr.
853  Gray.  Don't frown.  You have.  And beauty is a form of genius--is
854  higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation.  It is of the
855  great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the
856  reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon.  It
857  cannot be questioned.  It has its divine right of sovereignty.  It
858  makes princes of those who have it.  You smile?  Ah! when you have lost
859  it you won't smile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only
860  superficial.  That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as
861  thought is.  To me, beauty is the wonder of wonders.  It is only
862  shallow people who do not judge by appearances.  The true mystery of
863  the world is the visible, not the invisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the
864  gods have been good to you.  But what the gods give they quickly take
865  away.  You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly,
866  and fully.  When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then
867  you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or
868  have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of
869  your past will make more bitter than defeats.  Every month as it wanes
870  brings you nearer to something dreadful.  Time is jealous of you, and
871  wars against your lilies and your roses.  You will become sallow, and
872  hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed.  You will suffer horribly.... Ah!
873  realize your youth while you have it.  Don't squander the gold of your
874  days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure,
875  or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar.
876  These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age.  Live!  Live
877  the wonderful life that is in you!  Let nothing be lost upon you.  Be
878  always searching for new sensations.  Be afraid of nothing.... A new
879  Hedonism--that is what our century wants.  You might be its visible
880  symbol.  With your personality there is nothing you could not do.  The
881  world belongs to you for a season.... The moment I met you I saw that
882  you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really
883  might be.  There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must
884  tell you something about yourself.  I thought how tragic it would be if
885  you were wasted.  For there is such a little time that your youth will
886  last--such a little time.  The common hill-flowers wither, but they
887  blossom again.  The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now.
888  In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after
889  year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars.  But we
890  never get back our youth.  The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty
891  becomes sluggish.  Our limbs fail, our senses rot.  We degenerate into
892  hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were
893  too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the
894  courage to yield to.  Youth!  Youth!  There is absolutely nothing in
895  the world but youth!"
896  
897  Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering.  The spray of lilac fell
898  from his hand upon the gravel.  A furry bee came and buzzed round it
899  for a moment.  Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated
900  globe of the tiny blossoms.  He watched it with that strange interest
901  in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import
902  make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we
903  cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays
904  sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield.  After a time the
905  bee flew away.  He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian
906  convolvulus.  The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to
907  and fro.
908  
909  Suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made
910  staccato signs for them to come in.  They turned to each other and
911  smiled.
912  
913  "I am waiting," he cried.  "Do come in.  The light is quite perfect,
914  and you can bring your drinks."
915  
916  They rose up and sauntered down the walk together.  Two green-and-white
917  butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of
918  the garden a thrush began to sing.
919  
920  "You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray," said Lord Henry, looking at
921  him.
922  
923  "Yes, I am glad now.  I wonder shall I always be glad?"
924  
925  "Always!  That is a dreadful word.  It makes me shudder when I hear it.
926  Women are so fond of using it.  They spoil every romance by trying to
927  make it last for ever.  It is a meaningless word, too.  The only
928  difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice
929  lasts a little longer."
930  
931  As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry's
932  arm.  "In that case, let our friendship be a caprice," he murmured,
933  flushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and
934  resumed his pose.
935  
936  Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him.
937  The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that
938  broke the stillness, except when, now and then, Hallward stepped back
939  to look at his work from a distance.  In the slanting beams that
940  streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden.  The
941  heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.
942  
943  After about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked for
944  a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture,
945  biting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning.  "It is quite
946  finished," he cried at last, and stooping down he wrote his name in
947  long vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.
948  
949  Lord Henry came over and examined the picture.  It was certainly a
950  wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.
951  
952  "My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly," he said.  "It is the
953  finest portrait of modern times.  Mr. Gray, come over and look at
954  yourself."
955  
956  The lad started, as if awakened from some dream.
957  
958  "Is it really finished?" he murmured, stepping down from the platform.
959  
960  "Quite finished," said the painter.  "And you have sat splendidly
961  to-day. I am awfully obliged to you."
962  
963  "That is entirely due to me," broke in Lord Henry.  "Isn't it, Mr.
964  Gray?"
965  
966  Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture
967  and turned towards it.  When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks
968  flushed for a moment with pleasure.  A look of joy came into his eyes,
969  as if he had recognized himself for the first time.  He stood there
970  motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to
971  him, but not catching the meaning of his words.  The sense of his own
972  beauty came on him like a revelation.  He had never felt it before.
973  Basil Hallward's compliments had seemed to him to be merely the
974  charming exaggeration of friendship.  He had listened to them, laughed
975  at them, forgotten them.  They had not influenced his nature.  Then had
976  come Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his
977  terrible warning of its brevity.  That had stirred him at the time, and
978  now, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full
979  reality of the description flashed across him.  Yes, there would be a
980  day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and
981  colourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed.  The scarlet
982  would pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his hair.  The
983  life that was to make his soul would mar his body.  He would become
984  dreadful, hideous, and uncouth.
985  
986  As he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a
987  knife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver.  His eyes
988  deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears.  He felt
989  as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.
990  
991  "Don't you like it?" cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the
992  lad's silence, not understanding what it meant.
993  
994  "Of course he likes it," said Lord Henry.  "Who wouldn't like it?  It
995  is one of the greatest things in modern art.  I will give you anything
996  you like to ask for it.  I must have it."
997  
998  "It is not my property, Harry."
999  
1000  "Whose property is it?"
1001  
1002  "Dorian's, of course," answered the painter.
1003  
1004  "He is a very lucky fellow."
1005  
1006  "How sad it is!" murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon
1007  his own portrait.  "How sad it is!  I shall grow old, and horrible, and
1008  dreadful.  But this picture will remain always young.  It will never be
1009  older than this particular day of June.... If it were only the other
1010  way!  If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was
1011  to grow old!  For that--for that--I would give everything!  Yes, there
1012  is nothing in the whole world I would not give!  I would give my soul
1013  for that!"
1014  
1015  "You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil," cried Lord
1016  Henry, laughing.  "It would be rather hard lines on your work."
1017  
1018  "I should object very strongly, Harry," said Hallward.
1019  
1020  Dorian Gray turned and looked at him.  "I believe you would, Basil.
1021  You like your art better than your friends.  I am no more to you than a
1022  green bronze figure.  Hardly as much, I dare say."
1023  
1024  The painter stared in amazement.  It was so unlike Dorian to speak like
1025  that.  What had happened?  He seemed quite angry.  His face was flushed
1026  and his cheeks burning.
1027  
1028  "Yes," he continued, "I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your
1029  silver Faun.  You will like them always.  How long will you like me?
1030  Till I have my first wrinkle, I suppose.  I know, now, that when one
1031  loses one's good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything.
1032  Your picture has taught me that.  Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right.
1033  Youth is the only thing worth having.  When I find that I am growing
1034  old, I shall kill myself."
1035  
1036  Hallward turned pale and caught his hand.  "Dorian!  Dorian!" he cried,
1037  "don't talk like that.  I have never had such a friend as you, and I
1038  shall never have such another.  You are not jealous of material things,
1039  are you?--you who are finer than any of them!"
1040  
1041  "I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die.  I am jealous of
1042  the portrait you have painted of me.  Why should it keep what I must
1043  lose?  Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives
1044  something to it.  Oh, if it were only the other way!  If the picture
1045  could change, and I could be always what I am now!  Why did you paint
1046  it?  It will mock me some day--mock me horribly!"  The hot tears welled
1047  into his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself on the
1048  divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying.
1049  
1050  "This is your doing, Harry," said the painter bitterly.
1051  
1052  Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.  "It is the real Dorian Gray--that
1053  is all."
1054  
1055  "It is not."
1056  
1057  "If it is not, what have I to do with it?"
1058  
1059  "You should have gone away when I asked you," he muttered.
1060  
1061  "I stayed when you asked me," was Lord Henry's answer.
1062  
1063  "Harry, I can't quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between
1064  you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever
1065  done, and I will destroy it.  What is it but canvas and colour?  I will
1066  not let it come across our three lives and mar them."
1067  
1068  Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with pallid
1069  face and tear-stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over to the deal
1070  painting-table that was set beneath the high curtained window.  What
1071  was he doing there?  His fingers were straying about among the litter
1072  of tin tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something.  Yes, it was for
1073  the long palette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel.  He had
1074  found it at last.  He was going to rip up the canvas.
1075  
1076  With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to
1077  Hallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of
1078  the studio.  "Don't, Basil, don't!" he cried.  "It would be murder!"
1079  
1080  "I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian," said the painter
1081  coldly when he had recovered from his surprise.  "I never thought you
1082  would."
1083  
1084  "Appreciate it?  I am in love with it, Basil.  It is part of myself.  I
1085  feel that."
1086  
1087  "Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and
1088  sent home.  Then you can do what you like with yourself." And he walked
1089  across the room and rang the bell for tea.  "You will have tea, of
1090  course, Dorian?  And so will you, Harry?  Or do you object to such
1091  simple pleasures?"
1092  
1093  "I adore simple pleasures," said Lord Henry.  "They are the last refuge
1094  of the complex.  But I don't like scenes, except on the stage.  What
1095  absurd fellows you are, both of you!  I wonder who it was defined man
1096  as a rational animal.  It was the most premature definition ever given.
1097  Man is many things, but he is not rational.  I am glad he is not, after
1098  all--though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture.  You
1099  had much better let me have it, Basil.  This silly boy doesn't really
1100  want it, and I really do."
1101  
1102  "If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive you!"
1103  cried Dorian Gray; "and I don't allow people to call me a silly boy."
1104  
1105  "You know the picture is yours, Dorian.  I gave it to you before it
1106  existed."
1107  
1108  "And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you
1109  don't really object to being reminded that you are extremely young."
1110  
1111  "I should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord Henry."
1112  
1113  "Ah! this morning!  You have lived since then."
1114  
1115  There came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a laden
1116  tea-tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table.  There was a
1117  rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn.
1118  Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page.  Dorian Gray
1119  went over and poured out the tea.  The two men sauntered languidly to
1120  the table and examined what was under the covers.
1121  
1122  "Let us go to the theatre to-night," said Lord Henry.  "There is sure
1123  to be something on, somewhere.  I have promised to dine at White's, but
1124  it is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire to say that I
1125  am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a
1126  subsequent engagement.  I think that would be a rather nice excuse:  it
1127  would have all the surprise of candour."
1128  
1129  "It is such a bore putting on one's dress-clothes," muttered Hallward.
1130  "And, when one has them on, they are so horrid."
1131  
1132  "Yes," answered Lord Henry dreamily, "the costume of the nineteenth
1133  century is detestable.  It is so sombre, so depressing.  Sin is the
1134  only real colour-element left in modern life."
1135  
1136  "You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry."
1137  
1138  "Before which Dorian?  The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the
1139  one in the picture?"
1140  
1141  "Before either."
1142  
1143  "I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry," said the
1144  lad.
1145  
1146  "Then you shall come; and you will come, too, Basil, won't you?"
1147  
1148  "I can't, really.  I would sooner not.  I have a lot of work to do."
1149  
1150  "Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray."
1151  
1152  "I should like that awfully."
1153  
1154  The painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture.
1155  "I shall stay with the real Dorian," he said, sadly.
1156  
1157  "Is it the real Dorian?" cried the original of the portrait, strolling
1158  across to him.  "Am I really like that?"
1159  
1160  "Yes; you are just like that."
1161  
1162  "How wonderful, Basil!"
1163  
1164  "At least you are like it in appearance.  But it will never alter,"
1165  sighed Hallward.  "That is something."
1166  
1167  "What a fuss people make about fidelity!" exclaimed Lord Henry.  "Why,
1168  even in love it is purely a question for physiology.  It has nothing to
1169  do with our own will.  Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old
1170  men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say."
1171  
1172  "Don't go to the theatre to-night, Dorian," said Hallward.  "Stop and
1173  dine with me."
1174  
1175  "I can't, Basil."
1176  
1177  "Why?"
1178  
1179  "Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him."
1180  
1181  "He won't like you the better for keeping your promises.  He always
1182  breaks his own.  I beg you not to go."
1183  
1184  Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.
1185  
1186  "I entreat you."
1187  
1188  The lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them
1189  from the tea-table with an amused smile.
1190  
1191  "I must go, Basil," he answered.
1192  
1193  "Very well," said Hallward, and he went over and laid down his cup on
1194  the tray.  "It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had
1195  better lose no time.  Good-bye, Harry.  Good-bye, Dorian.  Come and see
1196  me soon.  Come to-morrow."
1197  
1198  "Certainly."
1199  
1200  "You won't forget?"
1201  
1202  "No, of course not," cried Dorian.
1203  
1204  "And ... Harry!"
1205  
1206  "Yes, Basil?"
1207  
1208  "Remember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this morning."
1209  
1210  "I have forgotten it."
1211  
1212  "I trust you."
1213  
1214  "I wish I could trust myself," said Lord Henry, laughing.  "Come, Mr.
1215  Gray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place.
1216  Good-bye, Basil.  It has been a most interesting afternoon."
1217  
1218  As the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a
1219  sofa, and a look of pain came into his face.
1220  
1221  
1222  
1223  CHAPTER 3
1224  
1225  At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon
1226  Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial
1227  if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called
1228  selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was
1229  considered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him.
1230  His father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young
1231  and Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a
1232  capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at
1233  Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by
1234  reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches,
1235  and his inordinate passion for pleasure.  The son, who had been his
1236  father's secretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat
1237  foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months
1238  later to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great
1239  aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing.  He had two large town
1240  houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and
1241  took most of his meals at his club.  He paid some attention to the
1242  management of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself
1243  for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of
1244  having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of
1245  burning wood on his own hearth.  In politics he was a Tory, except when
1246  the Tories were in office, during which period he roundly abused them
1247  for being a pack of Radicals.  He was a hero to his valet, who bullied
1248  him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn.
1249  Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the
1250  country was going to the dogs.  His principles were out of date, but
1251  there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices.
1252  
1253  When Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a rough
1254  shooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over _The Times_.  "Well,
1255  Harry," said the old gentleman, "what brings you out so early?  I
1256  thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till
1257  five."
1258  
1259  "Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George.  I want to get
1260  something out of you."
1261  
1262  "Money, I suppose," said Lord Fermor, making a wry face.  "Well, sit
1263  down and tell me all about it.  Young people, nowadays, imagine that
1264  money is everything."
1265  
1266  "Yes," murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; "and
1267  when they grow older they know it.  But I don't want money.  It is only
1268  people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay
1269  mine.  Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly
1270  upon it.  Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor's tradesmen, and
1271  consequently they never bother me.  What I want is information:  not
1272  useful information, of course; useless information."
1273  
1274  "Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry,
1275  although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense.  When I was in
1276  the Diplomatic, things were much better.  But I hear they let them in
1277  now by examination.  What can you expect?  Examinations, sir, are pure
1278  humbug from beginning to end.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite
1279  enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him."
1280  
1281  "Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George," said
1282  Lord Henry languidly.
1283  
1284  "Mr. Dorian Gray?  Who is he?" asked Lord Fermor, knitting his bushy
1285  white eyebrows.
1286  
1287  "That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George.  Or rather, I know
1288  who he is.  He is the last Lord Kelso's grandson.  His mother was a
1289  Devereux, Lady Margaret Devereux.  I want you to tell me about his
1290  mother.  What was she like?  Whom did she marry?  You have known nearly
1291  everybody in your time, so you might have known her.  I am very much
1292  interested in Mr. Gray at present.  I have only just met him."
1293  
1294  "Kelso's grandson!" echoed the old gentleman.  "Kelso's grandson! ...
1295  Of course.... I knew his mother intimately.  I believe I was at her
1296  christening.  She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret
1297  Devereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless
1298  young fellow--a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot regiment, or
1299  something of that kind.  Certainly.  I remember the whole thing as if
1300  it happened yesterday.  The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few
1301  months after the marriage.  There was an ugly story about it.  They
1302  said Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult
1303  his son-in-law in public--paid him, sir, to do it, paid him--and that
1304  the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon.  The thing was
1305  hushed up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some
1306  time afterwards.  He brought his daughter back with him, I was told,
1307  and she never spoke to him again.  Oh, yes; it was a bad business.  The
1308  girl died, too, died within a year.  So she left a son, did she?  I had
1309  forgotten that.  What sort of boy is he?  If he is like his mother, he
1310  must be a good-looking chap."
1311  
1312  "He is very good-looking," assented Lord Henry.
1313  
1314  "I hope he will fall into proper hands," continued the old man.  "He
1315  should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right thing
1316  by him.  His mother had money, too.  All the Selby property came to
1317  her, through her grandfather.  Her grandfather hated Kelso, thought him
1318  a mean dog.  He was, too.  Came to Madrid once when I was there.  Egad,
1319  I was ashamed of him.  The Queen used to ask me about the English noble
1320  who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares.  They
1321  made quite a story of it.  I didn't dare show my face at Court for a
1322  month.  I hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies."
1323  
1324  "I don't know," answered Lord Henry.  "I fancy that the boy will be
1325  well off.  He is not of age yet.  He has Selby, I know.  He told me so.
1326  And ... his mother was very beautiful?"
1327  
1328  "Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw,
1329  Harry.  What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could
1330  understand.  She could have married anybody she chose.  Carlington was
1331  mad after her.  She was romantic, though.  All the women of that family
1332  were.  The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the women were wonderful.
1333  Carlington went on his knees to her.  Told me so himself.  She laughed
1334  at him, and there wasn't a girl in London at the time who wasn't after
1335  him.  And by the way, Harry, talking about silly marriages, what is
1336  this humbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an
1337  American?  Ain't English girls good enough for him?"
1338  
1339  "It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle George."
1340  
1341  "I'll back English women against the world, Harry," said Lord Fermor,
1342  striking the table with his fist.
1343  
1344  "The betting is on the Americans."
1345  
1346  "They don't last, I am told," muttered his uncle.
1347  
1348  "A long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a
1349  steeplechase.  They take things flying.  I don't think Dartmoor has a
1350  chance."
1351  
1352  "Who are her people?" grumbled the old gentleman.  "Has she got any?"
1353  
1354  Lord Henry shook his head.  "American girls are as clever at concealing
1355  their parents, as English women are at concealing their past," he said,
1356  rising to go.
1357  
1358  "They are pork-packers, I suppose?"
1359  
1360  "I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor's sake.  I am told that
1361  pork-packing is the most lucrative profession in America, after
1362  politics."
1363  
1364  "Is she pretty?"
1365  
1366  "She behaves as if she was beautiful.  Most American women do.  It is
1367  the secret of their charm."
1368  
1369  "Why can't these American women stay in their own country?  They are
1370  always telling us that it is the paradise for women."
1371  
1372  "It is.  That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively
1373  anxious to get out of it," said Lord Henry.  "Good-bye, Uncle George.
1374  I shall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer.  Thanks for giving me
1375  the information I wanted.  I always like to know everything about my
1376  new friends, and nothing about my old ones."
1377  
1378  "Where are you lunching, Harry?"
1379  
1380  "At Aunt Agatha's. I have asked myself and Mr. Gray.  He is her latest
1381  _protege_."
1382  
1383  "Humph! tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me any more with
1384  her charity appeals.  I am sick of them.  Why, the good woman thinks
1385  that I have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads."
1386  
1387  "All right, Uncle George, I'll tell her, but it won't have any effect.
1388  Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity.  It is their
1389  distinguishing characteristic."
1390  
1391  The old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his
1392  servant.  Lord Henry passed up the low arcade into Burlington Street
1393  and turned his steps in the direction of Berkeley Square.
1394  
1395  So that was the story of Dorian Gray's parentage.  Crudely as it had
1396  been told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a
1397  strange, almost modern romance.  A beautiful woman risking everything
1398  for a mad passion.  A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a
1399  hideous, treacherous crime.  Months of voiceless agony, and then a
1400  child born in pain.  The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to
1401  solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man.  Yes; it was an
1402  interesting background.  It posed the lad, made him more perfect, as it
1403  were.  Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something
1404  tragic.  Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might
1405  blow.... And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as
1406  with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat
1407  opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer
1408  rose the wakening wonder of his face.  Talking to him was like playing
1409  upon an exquisite violin.  He answered to every touch and thrill of the
1410  bow.... There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of
1411  influence.  No other activity was like it.  To project one's soul into
1412  some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one's
1413  own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of
1414  passion and youth; to convey one's temperament into another as though
1415  it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in
1416  that--perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited
1417  and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and
1418  grossly common in its aims.... He was a marvellous type, too, this lad,
1419  whom by so curious a chance he had met in Basil's studio, or could be
1420  fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate.  Grace was his, and the
1421  white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for
1422  us.  There was nothing that one could not do with him.  He could be
1423  made a Titan or a toy.  What a pity it was that such beauty was
1424  destined to fade! ...  And Basil?  From a psychological point of view,
1425  how interesting he was!  The new manner in art, the fresh mode of
1426  looking at life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence
1427  of one who was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in
1428  dim woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing
1429  herself, Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for
1430  her there had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are
1431  wonderful things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things
1432  becoming, as it were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value,
1433  as though they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect
1434  form whose shadow they made real:  how strange it all was!  He
1435  remembered something like it in history.  Was it not Plato, that artist
1436  in thought, who had first analyzed it?  Was it not Buonarotti who had
1437  carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own
1438  century it was strange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray
1439  what, without knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned
1440  the wonderful portrait.  He would seek to dominate him--had already,
1441  indeed, half done so.  He would make that wonderful spirit his own.
1442  There was something fascinating in this son of love and death.
1443  
1444  Suddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses.  He found that he had
1445  passed his aunt's some distance, and, smiling to himself, turned back.
1446  When he entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him that they
1447  had gone in to lunch.  He gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and
1448  passed into the dining-room.
1449  
1450  "Late as usual, Harry," cried his aunt, shaking her head at him.
1451  
1452  He invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat next to
1453  her, looked round to see who was there.  Dorian bowed to him shyly from
1454  the end of the table, a flush of pleasure stealing into his cheek.
1455  Opposite was the Duchess of Harley, a lady of admirable good-nature and
1456  good temper, much liked by every one who knew her, and of those ample
1457  architectural proportions that in women who are not duchesses are
1458  described by contemporary historians as stoutness.  Next to her sat, on
1459  her right, Sir Thomas Burdon, a Radical member of Parliament, who
1460  followed his leader in public life and in private life followed the
1461  best cooks, dining with the Tories and thinking with the Liberals, in
1462  accordance with a wise and well-known rule.  The post on her left was
1463  occupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an old gentleman of considerable
1464  charm and culture, who had fallen, however, into bad habits of silence,
1465  having, as he explained once to Lady Agatha, said everything that he
1466  had to say before he was thirty.  His own neighbour was Mrs. Vandeleur,
1467  one of his aunt's oldest friends, a perfect saint amongst women, but so
1468  dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly bound hymn-book.
1469  Fortunately for him she had on the other side Lord Faudel, a most
1470  intelligent middle-aged mediocrity, as bald as a ministerial statement
1471  in the House of Commons, with whom she was conversing in that intensely
1472  earnest manner which is the one unpardonable error, as he remarked once
1473  himself, that all really good people fall into, and from which none of
1474  them ever quite escape.
1475  
1476  "We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry," cried the duchess,
1477  nodding pleasantly to him across the table.  "Do you think he will
1478  really marry this fascinating young person?"
1479  
1480  "I believe she has made up her mind to propose to him, Duchess."
1481  
1482  "How dreadful!" exclaimed Lady Agatha.  "Really, some one should
1483  interfere."
1484  
1485  "I am told, on excellent authority, that her father keeps an American
1486  dry-goods store," said Sir Thomas Burdon, looking supercilious.
1487  
1488  "My uncle has already suggested pork-packing, Sir Thomas."
1489  
1490  "Dry-goods! What are American dry-goods?" asked the duchess, raising
1491  her large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb.
1492  
1493  "American novels," answered Lord Henry, helping himself to some quail.
1494  
1495  The duchess looked puzzled.
1496  
1497  "Don't mind him, my dear," whispered Lady Agatha.  "He never means
1498  anything that he says."
1499  
1500  "When America was discovered," said the Radical member--and he began to
1501  give some wearisome facts.  Like all people who try to exhaust a
1502  subject, he exhausted his listeners.  The duchess sighed and exercised
1503  her privilege of interruption.  "I wish to goodness it never had been
1504  discovered at all!" she exclaimed.  "Really, our girls have no chance
1505  nowadays.  It is most unfair."
1506  
1507  "Perhaps, after all, America never has been discovered," said Mr.
1508  Erskine; "I myself would say that it had merely been detected."
1509  
1510  "Oh! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants," answered the
1511  duchess vaguely.  "I must confess that most of them are extremely
1512  pretty.  And they dress well, too.  They get all their dresses in
1513  Paris.  I wish I could afford to do the same."
1514  
1515  "They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris," chuckled Sir
1516  Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour's cast-off clothes.
1517  
1518  "Really!  And where do bad Americans go to when they die?" inquired the
1519  duchess.
1520  
1521  "They go to America," murmured Lord Henry.
1522  
1523  Sir Thomas frowned.  "I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced
1524  against that great country," he said to Lady Agatha.  "I have travelled
1525  all over it in cars provided by the directors, who, in such matters,
1526  are extremely civil.  I assure you that it is an education to visit it."
1527  
1528  "But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?" asked Mr.
1529  Erskine plaintively.  "I don't feel up to the journey."
1530  
1531  Sir Thomas waved his hand.  "Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on
1532  his shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to read about
1533  them. The Americans are an extremely interesting people. They are
1534  absolutely reasonable. I think that is their distinguishing
1535  characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people. I
1536  assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans."
1537  
1538  "How dreadful!" cried Lord Henry.  "I can stand brute force, but brute
1539  reason is quite unbearable.  There is something unfair about its use.
1540  It is hitting below the intellect."
1541  
1542  "I do not understand you," said Sir Thomas, growing rather red.
1543  
1544  "I do, Lord Henry," murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.
1545  
1546  "Paradoxes are all very well in their way...." rejoined the baronet.
1547  
1548  "Was that a paradox?" asked Mr. Erskine.  "I did not think so.  Perhaps
1549  it was.  Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth.  To test
1550  reality we must see it on the tight rope.  When the verities become
1551  acrobats, we can judge them."
1552  
1553  "Dear me!" said Lady Agatha, "how you men argue!  I am sure I never can
1554  make out what you are talking about.  Oh!  Harry, I am quite vexed with
1555  you.  Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up
1556  the East End?  I assure you he would be quite invaluable.  They would
1557  love his playing."
1558  
1559  "I want him to play to me," cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he looked
1560  down the table and caught a bright answering glance.
1561  
1562  "But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel," continued Lady Agatha.
1563  
1564  "I can sympathize with everything except suffering," said Lord Henry,
1565  shrugging his shoulders.  "I cannot sympathize with that.  It is too
1566  ugly, too horrible, too distressing.  There is something terribly
1567  morbid in the modern sympathy with pain.  One should sympathize with
1568  the colour, the beauty, the joy of life.  The less said about life's
1569  sores, the better."
1570  
1571  "Still, the East End is a very important problem," remarked Sir Thomas
1572  with a grave shake of the head.
1573  
1574  "Quite so," answered the young lord.  "It is the problem of slavery,
1575  and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves."
1576  
1577  The politician looked at him keenly.  "What change do you propose,
1578  then?" he asked.
1579  
1580  Lord Henry laughed.  "I don't desire to change anything in England
1581  except the weather," he answered.  "I am quite content with philosophic
1582  contemplation.  But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt
1583  through an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should
1584  appeal to science to put us straight.  The advantage of the emotions is
1585  that they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is
1586  not emotional."
1587  
1588  "But we have such grave responsibilities," ventured Mrs. Vandeleur
1589  timidly.
1590  
1591  "Terribly grave," echoed Lady Agatha.
1592  
1593  Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine.  "Humanity takes itself too
1594  seriously.  It is the world's original sin.  If the caveman had known
1595  how to laugh, history would have been different."
1596  
1597  "You are really very comforting," warbled the duchess.  "I have always
1598  felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no
1599  interest at all in the East End.  For the future I shall be able to
1600  look her in the face without a blush."
1601  
1602  "A blush is very becoming, Duchess," remarked Lord Henry.
1603  
1604  "Only when one is young," she answered.  "When an old woman like myself
1605  blushes, it is a very bad sign.  Ah!  Lord Henry, I wish you would tell
1606  me how to become young again."
1607  
1608  He thought for a moment.  "Can you remember any great error that you
1609  committed in your early days, Duchess?" he asked, looking at her across
1610  the table.
1611  
1612  "A great many, I fear," she cried.
1613  
1614  "Then commit them over again," he said gravely.  "To get back one's
1615  youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies."
1616  
1617  "A delightful theory!" she exclaimed.  "I must put it into practice."
1618  
1619  "A dangerous theory!" came from Sir Thomas's tight lips.  Lady Agatha
1620  shook her head, but could not help being amused.  Mr. Erskine listened.
1621  
1622  "Yes," he continued, "that is one of the great secrets of life.
1623  Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and
1624  discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are
1625  one's mistakes."
1626  
1627  A laugh ran round the table.
1628  
1629  He played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and
1630  transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent
1631  with fancy and winged it with paradox.  The praise of folly, as he went
1632  on, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy herself became young, and
1633  catching the mad music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her
1634  wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a Bacchante over the
1635  hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober.  Facts fled
1636  before her like frightened forest things.  Her white feet trod the huge
1637  press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round
1638  her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over
1639  the vat's black, dripping, sloping sides.  It was an extraordinary
1640  improvisation.  He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him,
1641  and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose
1642  temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and
1643  to lend colour to his imagination.  He was brilliant, fantastic,
1644  irresponsible.  He charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they
1645  followed his pipe, laughing.  Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him,
1646  but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips
1647  and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes.
1648  
1649  At last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room
1650  in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was
1651  waiting.  She wrung her hands in mock despair.  "How annoying!" she
1652  cried.  "I must go.  I have to call for my husband at the club, to take
1653  him to some absurd meeting at Willis's Rooms, where he is going to be
1654  in the chair.  If I am late he is sure to be furious, and I couldn't
1655  have a scene in this bonnet.  It is far too fragile.  A harsh word
1656  would ruin it.  No, I must go, dear Agatha.  Good-bye, Lord Henry, you
1657  are quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing.  I am sure I don't
1658  know what to say about your views.  You must come and dine with us some
1659  night.  Tuesday?  Are you disengaged Tuesday?"
1660  
1661  "For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess," said Lord Henry with a
1662  bow.
1663  
1664  "Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you," she cried; "so mind you
1665  come"; and she swept out of the room, followed by Lady Agatha and the
1666  other ladies.
1667  
1668  When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and taking
1669  a chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm.
1670  
1671  "You talk books away," he said; "why don't you write one?"
1672  
1673  "I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine.  I
1674  should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be as lovely
1675  as a Persian carpet and as unreal.  But there is no literary public in
1676  England for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias.
1677  Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the
1678  beauty of literature."
1679  
1680  "I fear you are right," answered Mr. Erskine.  "I myself used to have
1681  literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago.  And now, my dear
1682  young friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask if you
1683  really meant all that you said to us at lunch?"
1684  
1685  "I quite forget what I said," smiled Lord Henry.  "Was it all very bad?"
1686  
1687  "Very bad indeed.  In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if
1688  anything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on you as being
1689  primarily responsible.  But I should like to talk to you about life.
1690  The generation into which I was born was tedious.  Some day, when you
1691  are tired of London, come down to Treadley and expound to me your
1692  philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate
1693  enough to possess."
1694  
1695  "I shall be charmed.  A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege.
1696  It has a perfect host, and a perfect library."
1697  
1698  "You will complete it," answered the old gentleman with a courteous
1699  bow.  "And now I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt.  I am due at
1700  the Athenaeum.  It is the hour when we sleep there."
1701  
1702  "All of you, Mr. Erskine?"
1703  
1704  "Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an English
1705  Academy of Letters."
1706  
1707  Lord Henry laughed and rose.  "I am going to the park," he cried.
1708  
1709  As he was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him on the arm.
1710  "Let me come with you," he murmured.
1711  
1712  "But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him,"
1713  answered Lord Henry.
1714  
1715  "I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you.  Do
1716  let me.  And you will promise to talk to me all the time?  No one talks
1717  so wonderfully as you do."
1718  
1719  "Ah!  I have talked quite enough for to-day," said Lord Henry, smiling.
1720  "All I want now is to look at life.  You may come and look at it with
1721  me, if you care to."
1722  
1723  
1724  
1725  CHAPTER 4
1726  
1727  One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious
1728  arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry's house in Mayfair.  It
1729  was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high panelled
1730  wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling
1731  of raised plasterwork, and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk,
1732  long-fringed Persian rugs.  On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette
1733  by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound for
1734  Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve and powdered with the gilt daisies
1735  that Queen had selected for her device.  Some large blue china jars and
1736  parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small
1737  leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a
1738  summer day in London.
1739  
1740  Lord Henry had not yet come in.  He was always late on principle, his
1741  principle being that punctuality is the thief of time.  So the lad was
1742  looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he turned over the pages
1743  of an elaborately illustrated edition of Manon Lescaut that he had
1744  found in one of the book-cases. The formal monotonous ticking of the
1745  Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him.  Once or twice he thought of going
1746  away.
1747  
1748  At last he heard a step outside, and the door opened.  "How late you
1749  are, Harry!" he murmured.
1750  
1751  "I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray," answered a shrill voice.
1752  
1753  He glanced quickly round and rose to his feet.  "I beg your pardon.  I
1754  thought--"
1755  
1756  "You thought it was my husband.  It is only his wife.  You must let me
1757  introduce myself.  I know you quite well by your photographs.  I think
1758  my husband has got seventeen of them."
1759  
1760  "Not seventeen, Lady Henry?"
1761  
1762  "Well, eighteen, then.  And I saw you with him the other night at the
1763  opera."  She laughed nervously as she spoke, and watched him with her
1764  vague forget-me-not eyes.  She was a curious woman, whose dresses
1765  always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a
1766  tempest.  She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion
1767  was never returned, she had kept all her illusions.  She tried to look
1768  picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy.  Her name was
1769  Victoria, and she had a perfect mania for going to church.
1770  
1771  "That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?"
1772  
1773  "Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin.  I like Wagner's music better than
1774  anybody's. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other
1775  people hearing what one says.  That is a great advantage, don't you
1776  think so, Mr. Gray?"
1777  
1778  The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her
1779  fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife.
1780  
1781  Dorian smiled and shook his head:  "I am afraid I don't think so, Lady
1782  Henry.  I never talk during music--at least, during good music.  If one
1783  hears bad music, it is one's duty to drown it in conversation."
1784  
1785  "Ah! that is one of Harry's views, isn't it, Mr. Gray?  I always hear
1786  Harry's views from his friends.  It is the only way I get to know of
1787  them.  But you must not think I don't like good music.  I adore it, but
1788  I am afraid of it.  It makes me too romantic.  I have simply worshipped
1789  pianists--two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me.  I don't know what
1790  it is about them.  Perhaps it is that they are foreigners.  They all
1791  are, ain't they?  Even those that are born in England become foreigners
1792  after a time, don't they?  It is so clever of them, and such a
1793  compliment to art.  Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn't it?  You have
1794  never been to any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray?  You must come.  I
1795  can't afford orchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners.  They make
1796  one's rooms look so picturesque.  But here is Harry!  Harry, I came in
1797  to look for you, to ask you something--I forget what it was--and I
1798  found Mr. Gray here.  We have had such a pleasant chat about music.  We
1799  have quite the same ideas.  No; I think our ideas are quite different.
1800  But he has been most pleasant.  I am so glad I've seen him."
1801  
1802  "I am charmed, my love, quite charmed," said Lord Henry, elevating his
1803  dark, crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused
1804  smile.  "So sorry I am late, Dorian.  I went to look after a piece of
1805  old brocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it.
1806  Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing."
1807  
1808  "I am afraid I must be going," exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an
1809  awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh.  "I have promised to drive
1810  with the duchess.  Good-bye, Mr. Gray.  Good-bye, Harry.  You are
1811  dining out, I suppose?  So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady
1812  Thornbury's."
1813  
1814  "I dare say, my dear," said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her
1815  as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the
1816  rain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of
1817  frangipanni.  Then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the
1818  sofa.
1819  
1820  "Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian," he said after a
1821  few puffs.
1822  
1823  "Why, Harry?"
1824  
1825  "Because they are so sentimental."
1826  
1827  "But I like sentimental people."
1828  
1829  "Never marry at all, Dorian.  Men marry because they are tired; women,
1830  because they are curious:  both are disappointed."
1831  
1832  "I don't think I am likely to marry, Harry.  I am too much in love.
1833  That is one of your aphorisms.  I am putting it into practice, as I do
1834  everything that you say."
1835  
1836  "Who are you in love with?" asked Lord Henry after a pause.
1837  
1838  "With an actress," said Dorian Gray, blushing.
1839  
1840  Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.  "That is a rather commonplace
1841  _debut_."
1842  
1843  "You would not say so if you saw her, Harry."
1844  
1845  "Who is she?"
1846  
1847  "Her name is Sibyl Vane."
1848  
1849  "Never heard of her."
1850  
1851  "No one has.  People will some day, however.  She is a genius."
1852  
1853  "My dear boy, no woman is a genius.  Women are a decorative sex.  They
1854  never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly.  Women
1855  represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the
1856  triumph of mind over morals."
1857  
1858  "Harry, how can you?"
1859  
1860  "My dear Dorian, it is quite true.  I am analysing women at present, so
1861  I ought to know.  The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was.
1862  I find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain
1863  and the coloured.  The plain women are very useful.  If you want to
1864  gain a reputation for respectability, you have merely to take them down
1865  to supper.  The other women are very charming.  They commit one
1866  mistake, however.  They paint in order to try and look young.  Our
1867  grandmothers painted in order to try and talk brilliantly.  _Rouge_ and
1868  _esprit_ used to go together.  That is all over now.  As long as a woman
1869  can look ten years younger than her own daughter, she is perfectly
1870  satisfied.  As for conversation, there are only five women in London
1871  worth talking to, and two of these can't be admitted into decent
1872  society.  However, tell me about your genius.  How long have you known
1873  her?"
1874  
1875  "Ah!  Harry, your views terrify me."
1876  
1877  "Never mind that.  How long have you known her?"
1878  
1879  "About three weeks."
1880  
1881  "And where did you come across her?"
1882  
1883  "I will tell you, Harry, but you mustn't be unsympathetic about it.
1884  After all, it never would have happened if I had not met you.  You
1885  filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life.  For days
1886  after I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins.  As I lounged
1887  in the park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at every one
1888  who passed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort of lives they
1889  led.  Some of them fascinated me.  Others filled me with terror.  There
1890  was an exquisite poison in the air.  I had a passion for sensations....
1891  Well, one evening about seven o'clock, I determined to go out in search
1892  of some adventure.  I felt that this grey monstrous London of ours,
1893  with its myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and its splendid sins,
1894  as you once phrased it, must have something in store for me.  I fancied
1895  a thousand things.  The mere danger gave me a sense of delight.  I
1896  remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we
1897  first dined together, about the search for beauty being the real secret
1898  of life.  I don't know what I expected, but I went out and wandered
1899  eastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black
1900  grassless squares.  About half-past eight I passed by an absurd little
1901  theatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills.  A hideous
1902  Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, was
1903  standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar.  He had greasy
1904  ringlets, and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled
1905  shirt. 'Have a box, my Lord?' he said, when he saw me, and he took off
1906  his hat with an air of gorgeous servility.  There was something about
1907  him, Harry, that amused me.  He was such a monster.  You will laugh at
1908  me, I know, but I really went in and paid a whole guinea for the
1909  stage-box. To the present day I can't make out why I did so; and yet if
1910  I hadn't--my dear Harry, if I hadn't--I should have missed the greatest
1911  romance of my life.  I see you are laughing.  It is horrid of you!"
1912  
1913  "I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you.  But you
1914  should not say the greatest romance of your life.  You should say the
1915  first romance of your life.  You will always be loved, and you will
1916  always be in love with love.  A _grande passion_ is the privilege of
1917  people who have nothing to do.  That is the one use of the idle classes
1918  of a country.  Don't be afraid.  There are exquisite things in store
1919  for you.  This is merely the beginning."
1920  
1921  "Do you think my nature so shallow?" cried Dorian Gray angrily.
1922  
1923  "No; I think your nature so deep."
1924  
1925  "How do you mean?"
1926  
1927  "My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really
1928  the shallow people.  What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity,
1929  I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination.
1930  Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life
1931  of the intellect--simply a confession of failure.  Faithfulness!  I
1932  must analyse it some day.  The passion for property is in it.  There
1933  are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that
1934  others might pick them up.  But I don't want to interrupt you.  Go on
1935  with your story."
1936  
1937  "Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a
1938  vulgar drop-scene staring me in the face.  I looked out from behind the
1939  curtain and surveyed the house.  It was a tawdry affair, all Cupids and
1940  cornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake. The gallery and pit were
1941  fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty, and
1942  there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the
1943  dress-circle.  Women went about with oranges and ginger-beer, and there
1944  was a terrible consumption of nuts going on."
1945  
1946  "It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama."
1947  
1948  "Just like, I should fancy, and very depressing.  I began to wonder
1949  what on earth I should do when I caught sight of the play-bill.  What
1950  do you think the play was, Harry?"
1951  
1952  "I should think 'The Idiot Boy', or 'Dumb but Innocent'.  Our fathers
1953  used to like that sort of piece, I believe.  The longer I live, Dorian,
1954  the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is
1955  not good enough for us.  In art, as in politics, _les grandperes ont
1956  toujours tort_."
1957  
1958  "This play was good enough for us, Harry.  It was Romeo and Juliet.  I
1959  must admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare
1960  done in such a wretched hole of a place.  Still, I felt interested, in
1961  a sort of way.  At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act.
1962  There was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Hebrew who sat
1963  at a cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the
1964  drop-scene was drawn up and the play began.  Romeo was a stout elderly
1965  gentleman, with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure
1966  like a beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad.  He was played by the
1967  low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most
1968  friendly terms with the pit.  They were both as grotesque as the
1969  scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. But
1970  Juliet!  Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a
1971  little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of
1972  dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were
1973  like the petals of a rose.  She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen
1974  in my life.  You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that
1975  beauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears.  I tell you,
1976  Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came
1977  across me.  And her voice--I never heard such a voice.  It was very low
1978  at first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one's
1979  ear.  Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a
1980  distant hautboy.  In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy
1981  that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing.  There
1982  were moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins.  You
1983  know how a voice can stir one.  Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane
1984  are two things that I shall never forget.  When I close my eyes, I hear
1985  them, and each of them says something different.  I don't know which to
1986  follow.  Why should I not love her?  Harry, I do love her.  She is
1987  everything to me in life.  Night after night I go to see her play.  One
1988  evening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen.  I have
1989  seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from
1990  her lover's lips.  I have watched her wandering through the forest of
1991  Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap.
1992  She has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and
1993  given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of.  She has been
1994  innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike
1995  throat.  I have seen her in every age and in every costume.  Ordinary
1996  women never appeal to one's imagination.  They are limited to their
1997  century.  No glamour ever transfigures them.  One knows their minds as
1998  easily as one knows their bonnets.  One can always find them.  There is
1999  no mystery in any of them.  They ride in the park in the morning and
2000  chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon.  They have their stereotyped
2001  smile and their fashionable manner.  They are quite obvious.  But an
2002  actress!  How different an actress is!  Harry! why didn't you tell me
2003  that the only thing worth loving is an actress?"
2004  
2005  "Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian."
2006  
2007  "Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces."
2008  
2009  "Don't run down dyed hair and painted faces.  There is an extraordinary
2010  charm in them, sometimes," said Lord Henry.
2011  
2012  "I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane."
2013  
2014  "You could not have helped telling me, Dorian.  All through your life
2015  you will tell me everything you do."
2016  
2017  "Yes, Harry, I believe that is true.  I cannot help telling you things.
2018  You have a curious influence over me.  If I ever did a crime, I would
2019  come and confess it to you.  You would understand me."
2020  
2021  "People like you--the wilful sunbeams of life--don't commit crimes,
2022  Dorian.  But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same.  And
2023  now tell me--reach me the matches, like a good boy--thanks--what are
2024  your actual relations with Sibyl Vane?"
2025  
2026  Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes.
2027  "Harry!  Sibyl Vane is sacred!"
2028  
2029  "It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian," said
2030  Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice.  "But why
2031  should you be annoyed?  I suppose she will belong to you some day.
2032  When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one's self, and one
2033  always ends by deceiving others.  That is what the world calls a
2034  romance.  You know her, at any rate, I suppose?"
2035  
2036  "Of course I know her.  On the first night I was at the theatre, the
2037  horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over and
2038  offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her.  I was
2039  furious with him, and told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds
2040  of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona.  I
2041  think, from his blank look of amazement, that he was under the
2042  impression that I had taken too much champagne, or something."
2043  
2044  "I am not surprised."
2045  
2046  "Then he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers.  I told him I
2047  never even read them.  He seemed terribly disappointed at that, and
2048  confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy
2049  against him, and that they were every one of them to be bought."
2050  
2051  "I should not wonder if he was quite right there.  But, on the other
2052  hand, judging from their appearance, most of them cannot be at all
2053  expensive."
2054  
2055  "Well, he seemed to think they were beyond his means," laughed Dorian.
2056  "By this time, however, the lights were being put out in the theatre,
2057  and I had to go.  He wanted me to try some cigars that he strongly
2058  recommended.  I declined.  The next night, of course, I arrived at the
2059  place again.  When he saw me, he made me a low bow and assured me that
2060  I was a munificent patron of art.  He was a most offensive brute,
2061  though he had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare.  He told me
2062  once, with an air of pride, that his five bankruptcies were entirely
2063  due to 'The Bard,' as he insisted on calling him.  He seemed to think
2064  it a distinction."
2065  
2066  "It was a distinction, my dear Dorian--a great distinction.  Most
2067  people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose
2068  of life.  To have ruined one's self over poetry is an honour.  But when
2069  did you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?"
2070  
2071  "The third night.  She had been playing Rosalind.  I could not help
2072  going round.  I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked at
2073  me--at least I fancied that she had.  The old Jew was persistent.  He
2074  seemed determined to take me behind, so I consented.  It was curious my
2075  not wanting to know her, wasn't it?"
2076  
2077  "No; I don't think so."
2078  
2079  "My dear Harry, why?"
2080  
2081  "I will tell you some other time.  Now I want to know about the girl."
2082  
2083  "Sibyl?  Oh, she was so shy and so gentle.  There is something of a
2084  child about her.  Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told
2085  her what I thought of her performance, and she seemed quite unconscious
2086  of her power.  I think we were both rather nervous.  The old Jew stood
2087  grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom, making elaborate
2088  speeches about us both, while we stood looking at each other like
2089  children.  He would insist on calling me 'My Lord,' so I had to assure
2090  Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind.  She said quite simply to
2091  me, 'You look more like a prince.  I must call you Prince Charming.'"
2092  
2093  "Upon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments."
2094  
2095  "You don't understand her, Harry.  She regarded me merely as a person
2096  in a play.  She knows nothing of life.  She lives with her mother, a
2097  faded tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta
2098  dressing-wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she had seen
2099  better days."
2100  
2101  "I know that look.  It depresses me," murmured Lord Henry, examining
2102  his rings.
2103  
2104  "The Jew wanted to tell me her history, but I said it did not interest
2105  me."
2106  
2107  "You were quite right.  There is always something infinitely mean about
2108  other people's tragedies."
2109  
2110  "Sibyl is the only thing I care about.  What is it to me where she came
2111  from?  From her little head to her little feet, she is absolutely and
2112  entirely divine.  Every night of my life I go to see her act, and every
2113  night she is more marvellous."
2114  
2115  "That is the reason, I suppose, that you never dine with me now.  I
2116  thought you must have some curious romance on hand.  You have; but it
2117  is not quite what I expected."
2118  
2119  "My dear Harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, and I have
2120  been to the opera with you several times," said Dorian, opening his
2121  blue eyes in wonder.
2122  
2123  "You always come dreadfully late."
2124  
2125  "Well, I can't help going to see Sibyl play," he cried, "even if it is
2126  only for a single act.  I get hungry for her presence; and when I think
2127  of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I
2128  am filled with awe."
2129  
2130  "You can dine with me to-night, Dorian, can't you?"
2131  
2132  He shook his head.  "To-night she is Imogen," he answered, "and
2133  to-morrow night she will be Juliet."
2134  
2135  "When is she Sibyl Vane?"
2136  
2137  "Never."
2138  
2139  "I congratulate you."
2140  
2141  "How horrid you are!  She is all the great heroines of the world in
2142  one.  She is more than an individual.  You laugh, but I tell you she
2143  has genius.  I love her, and I must make her love me.  You, who know
2144  all the secrets of life, tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me!  I
2145  want to make Romeo jealous.  I want the dead lovers of the world to
2146  hear our laughter and grow sad.  I want a breath of our passion to stir
2147  their dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain.  My God,
2148  Harry, how I worship her!"  He was walking up and down the room as he
2149  spoke.  Hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks.  He was terribly
2150  excited.
2151  
2152  Lord Henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure.  How different
2153  he was now from the shy frightened boy he had met in Basil Hallward's
2154  studio!  His nature had developed like a flower, had borne blossoms of
2155  scarlet flame.  Out of its secret hiding-place had crept his soul, and
2156  desire had come to meet it on the way.
2157  
2158  "And what do you propose to do?" said Lord Henry at last.
2159  
2160  "I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act.  I
2161  have not the slightest fear of the result.  You are certain to
2162  acknowledge her genius.  Then we must get her out of the Jew's hands.
2163  She is bound to him for three years--at least for two years and eight
2164  months--from the present time.  I shall have to pay him something, of
2165  course.  When all that is settled, I shall take a West End theatre and
2166  bring her out properly.  She will make the world as mad as she has made
2167  me."
2168  
2169  "That would be impossible, my dear boy."
2170  
2171  "Yes, she will.  She has not merely art, consummate art-instinct, in
2172  her, but she has personality also; and you have often told me that it
2173  is personalities, not principles, that move the age."
2174  
2175  "Well, what night shall we go?"
2176  
2177  "Let me see.  To-day is Tuesday.  Let us fix to-morrow. She plays
2178  Juliet to-morrow."
2179  
2180  "All right.  The Bristol at eight o'clock; and I will get Basil."
2181  
2182  "Not eight, Harry, please.  Half-past six.  We must be there before the
2183  curtain rises.  You must see her in the first act, where she meets
2184  Romeo."
2185  
2186  "Half-past six!  What an hour!  It will be like having a meat-tea, or
2187  reading an English novel.  It must be seven.  No gentleman dines before
2188  seven.  Shall you see Basil between this and then?  Or shall I write to
2189  him?"
2190  
2191  "Dear Basil!  I have not laid eyes on him for a week.  It is rather
2192  horrid of me, as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful
2193  frame, specially designed by himself, and, though I am a little jealous
2194  of the picture for being a whole month younger than I am, I must admit
2195  that I delight in it.  Perhaps you had better write to him.  I don't
2196  want to see him alone.  He says things that annoy me.  He gives me good
2197  advice."
2198  
2199  Lord Henry smiled.  "People are very fond of giving away what they need
2200  most themselves.  It is what I call the depth of generosity."
2201  
2202  "Oh, Basil is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit
2203  of a Philistine.  Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered
2204  that."
2205  
2206  "Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into his
2207  work.  The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his
2208  prejudices, his principles, and his common sense.  The only artists I
2209  have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists.  Good
2210  artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly
2211  uninteresting in what they are.  A great poet, a really great poet, is
2212  the most unpoetical of all creatures.  But inferior poets are
2213  absolutely fascinating.  The worse their rhymes are, the more
2214  picturesque they look.  The mere fact of having published a book of
2215  second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible.  He lives the
2216  poetry that he cannot write.  The others write the poetry that they
2217  dare not realize."
2218  
2219  "I wonder is that really so, Harry?" said Dorian Gray, putting some
2220  perfume on his handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle that
2221  stood on the table.  "It must be, if you say it.  And now I am off.
2222  Imogen is waiting for me.  Don't forget about to-morrow. Good-bye."
2223  
2224  As he left the room, Lord Henry's heavy eyelids drooped, and he began
2225  to think.  Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as
2226  Dorian Gray, and yet the lad's mad adoration of some one else caused
2227  him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy.  He was pleased by
2228  it.  It made him a more interesting study.  He had been always
2229  enthralled by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary
2230  subject-matter of that science had seemed to him trivial and of no
2231  import.  And so he had begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by
2232  vivisecting others.  Human life--that appeared to him the one thing
2233  worth investigating.  Compared to it there was nothing else of any
2234  value.  It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of
2235  pain and pleasure, one could not wear over one's face a mask of glass,
2236  nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the
2237  imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams.  There
2238  were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken
2239  of them.  There were maladies so strange that one had to pass through
2240  them if one sought to understand their nature.  And, yet, what a great
2241  reward one received!  How wonderful the whole world became to one!  To
2242  note the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life
2243  of the intellect--to observe where they met, and where they separated,
2244  at what point they were in unison, and at what point they were at
2245  discord--there was a delight in that!  What matter what the cost was?
2246  One could never pay too high a price for any sensation.
2247  
2248  He was conscious--and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his
2249  brown agate eyes--that it was through certain words of his, musical
2250  words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray's soul had turned
2251  to this white girl and bowed in worship before her.  To a large extent
2252  the lad was his own creation.  He had made him premature.  That was
2253  something.  Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its
2254  secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were
2255  revealed before the veil was drawn away.  Sometimes this was the effect
2256  of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately
2257  with the passions and the intellect.  But now and then a complex
2258  personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed,
2259  in its way, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces,
2260  just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.
2261  
2262  Yes, the lad was premature.  He was gathering his harvest while it was
2263  yet spring.  The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was
2264  becoming self-conscious. It was delightful to watch him.  With his
2265  beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at.
2266  It was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end.  He was like
2267  one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem
2268  to be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one's sense of beauty,
2269  and whose wounds are like red roses.
2270  
2271  Soul and body, body and soul--how mysterious they were!  There was
2272  animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality.
2273  The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade.  Who could
2274  say where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began?
2275  How shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists!
2276  And yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various
2277  schools!  Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin?  Or was the
2278  body really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought?  The separation of
2279  spirit from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter
2280  was a mystery also.
2281  
2282  He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a
2283  science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us.  As it
2284  was, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others.
2285  Experience was of no ethical value.  It was merely the name men gave to
2286  their mistakes.  Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of
2287  warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation
2288  of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow
2289  and showed us what to avoid.  But there was no motive power in
2290  experience.  It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself.
2291  All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same
2292  as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we
2293  would do many times, and with joy.
2294  
2295  It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by
2296  which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and
2297  certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to
2298  promise rich and fruitful results.  His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane
2299  was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest.  There was no
2300  doubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire
2301  for new experiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex
2302  passion.  What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of
2303  boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination,
2304  changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from
2305  sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous.  It was the
2306  passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most
2307  strongly over us.  Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we
2308  were conscious.  It often happened that when we thought we were
2309  experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves.
2310  
2311  While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the
2312  door, and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for
2313  dinner.  He got up and looked out into the street.  The sunset had
2314  smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite.
2315  The panes glowed like plates of heated metal.  The sky above was like a
2316  faded rose.  He thought of his friend's young fiery-coloured life and
2317  wondered how it was all going to end.
2318  
2319  When he arrived home, about half-past twelve o'clock, he saw a telegram
2320  lying on the hall table.  He opened it and found it was from Dorian
2321  Gray.  It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl
2322  Vane.
2323  
2324  
2325  
2326  CHAPTER 5
2327  
2328  "Mother, Mother, I am so happy!" whispered the girl, burying her face
2329  in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to
2330  the shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair that their
2331  dingy sitting-room contained.  "I am so happy!" she repeated, "and you
2332  must be happy, too!"
2333  
2334  Mrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her
2335  daughter's head.  "Happy!" she echoed, "I am only happy, Sibyl, when I
2336  see you act.  You must not think of anything but your acting.  Mr.
2337  Isaacs has been very good to us, and we owe him money."
2338  
2339  The girl looked up and pouted.  "Money, Mother?" she cried, "what does
2340  money matter?  Love is more than money."
2341  
2342  "Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to
2343  get a proper outfit for James.  You must not forget that, Sibyl.  Fifty
2344  pounds is a very large sum.  Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate."
2345  
2346  "He is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he talks to me,"
2347  said the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the window.
2348  
2349  "I don't know how we could manage without him," answered the elder
2350  woman querulously.
2351  
2352  Sibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed.  "We don't want him any more,
2353  Mother.  Prince Charming rules life for us now." Then she paused.  A
2354  rose shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks.  Quick breath parted
2355  the petals of her lips.  They trembled.  Some southern wind of passion
2356  swept over her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress.  "I love
2357  him," she said simply.
2358  
2359  "Foolish child! foolish child!" was the parrot-phrase flung in answer.
2360  The waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the
2361  words.
2362  
2363  The girl laughed again.  The joy of a caged bird was in her voice.  Her
2364  eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then closed for a
2365  moment, as though to hide their secret.  When they opened, the mist of
2366  a dream had passed across them.
2367  
2368  Thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at
2369  prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name
2370  of common sense.  She did not listen.  She was free in her prison of
2371  passion.  Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her.  She had called on
2372  memory to remake him.  She had sent her soul to search for him, and it
2373  had brought him back.  His kiss burned again upon her mouth.  Her
2374  eyelids were warm with his breath.
2375  
2376  Then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery.  This
2377  young man might be rich.  If so, marriage should be thought of.
2378  Against the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning.  The
2379  arrows of craft shot by her.  She saw the thin lips moving, and smiled.
2380  
2381  Suddenly she felt the need to speak.  The wordy silence troubled her.
2382  "Mother, Mother," she cried, "why does he love me so much?  I know why
2383  I love him.  I love him because he is like what love himself should be.
2384  But what does he see in me?  I am not worthy of him.  And yet--why, I
2385  cannot tell--though I feel so much beneath him, I don't feel humble.  I
2386  feel proud, terribly proud.  Mother, did you love my father as I love
2387  Prince Charming?"
2388  
2389  The elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her
2390  cheeks, and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain.  Sybil rushed
2391  to her, flung her arms round her neck, and kissed her.  "Forgive me,
2392  Mother.  I know it pains you to talk about our father.  But it only
2393  pains you because you loved him so much.  Don't look so sad.  I am as
2394  happy to-day as you were twenty years ago.  Ah! let me be happy for
2395  ever!"
2396  
2397  "My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love.  Besides,
2398  what do you know of this young man?  You don't even know his name.  The
2399  whole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away
2400  to Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you
2401  should have shown more consideration.  However, as I said before, if he
2402  is rich ..."
2403  
2404  "Ah!  Mother, Mother, let me be happy!"
2405  
2406  Mrs. Vane glanced at her, and with one of those false theatrical
2407  gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a
2408  stage-player, clasped her in her arms.  At this moment, the door opened
2409  and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room.  He was
2410  thick-set of figure, and his hands and feet were large and somewhat
2411  clumsy in movement.  He was not so finely bred as his sister.  One
2412  would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between
2413  them.  Mrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile.  She
2414  mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience.  She felt sure
2415  that the _tableau_ was interesting.
2416  
2417  "You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think," said the
2418  lad with a good-natured grumble.
2419  
2420  "Ah! but you don't like being kissed, Jim," she cried.  "You are a
2421  dreadful old bear."  And she ran across the room and hugged him.
2422  
2423  James Vane looked into his sister's face with tenderness.  "I want you
2424  to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl.  I don't suppose I shall ever
2425  see this horrid London again.  I am sure I don't want to."
2426  
2427  "My son, don't say such dreadful things," murmured Mrs. Vane, taking up
2428  a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it.  She
2429  felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group.  It would
2430  have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation.
2431  
2432  "Why not, Mother?  I mean it."
2433  
2434  "You pain me, my son.  I trust you will return from Australia in a
2435  position of affluence.  I believe there is no society of any kind in
2436  the Colonies--nothing that I would call society--so when you have made
2437  your fortune, you must come back and assert yourself in London."
2438  
2439  "Society!" muttered the lad.  "I don't want to know anything about
2440  that.  I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the
2441  stage.  I hate it."
2442  
2443  "Oh, Jim!" said Sibyl, laughing, "how unkind of you!  But are you
2444  really going for a walk with me?  That will be nice!  I was afraid you
2445  were going to say good-bye to some of your friends--to Tom Hardy, who
2446  gave you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you for
2447  smoking it.  It is very sweet of you to let me have your last
2448  afternoon.  Where shall we go?  Let us go to the park."
2449  
2450  "I am too shabby," he answered, frowning.  "Only swell people go to the
2451  park."
2452  
2453  "Nonsense, Jim," she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his coat.
2454  
2455  He hesitated for a moment.  "Very well," he said at last, "but don't be
2456  too long dressing."  She danced out of the door.  One could hear her
2457  singing as she ran upstairs.  Her little feet pattered overhead.
2458  
2459  He walked up and down the room two or three times.  Then he turned to
2460  the still figure in the chair.  "Mother, are my things ready?" he asked.
2461  
2462  "Quite ready, James," she answered, keeping her eyes on her work.  For
2463  some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this
2464  rough stern son of hers.  Her shallow secret nature was troubled when
2465  their eyes met.  She used to wonder if he suspected anything.  The
2466  silence, for he made no other observation, became intolerable to her.
2467  She began to complain.  Women defend themselves by attacking, just as
2468  they attack by sudden and strange surrenders.  "I hope you will be
2469  contented, James, with your sea-faring life," she said.  "You must
2470  remember that it is your own choice.  You might have entered a
2471  solicitor's office.  Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in
2472  the country often dine with the best families."
2473  
2474  "I hate offices, and I hate clerks," he replied.  "But you are quite
2475  right.  I have chosen my own life.  All I say is, watch over Sibyl.
2476  Don't let her come to any harm.  Mother, you must watch over her."
2477  
2478  "James, you really talk very strangely.  Of course I watch over Sibyl."
2479  
2480  "I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to
2481  talk to her.  Is that right?  What about that?"
2482  
2483  "You are speaking about things you don't understand, James.  In the
2484  profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying
2485  attention.  I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time.  That
2486  was when acting was really understood.  As for Sibyl, I do not know at
2487  present whether her attachment is serious or not.  But there is no
2488  doubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman.  He is
2489  always most polite to me.  Besides, he has the appearance of being
2490  rich, and the flowers he sends are lovely."
2491  
2492  "You don't know his name, though," said the lad harshly.
2493  
2494  "No," answered his mother with a placid expression in her face.  "He
2495  has not yet revealed his real name.  I think it is quite romantic of
2496  him.  He is probably a member of the aristocracy."
2497  
2498  James Vane bit his lip.  "Watch over Sibyl, Mother," he cried, "watch
2499  over her."
2500  
2501  "My son, you distress me very much.  Sibyl is always under my special
2502  care.  Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why
2503  she should not contract an alliance with him.  I trust he is one of the
2504  aristocracy.  He has all the appearance of it, I must say.  It might be
2505  a most brilliant marriage for Sibyl.  They would make a charming
2506  couple.  His good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices
2507  them."
2508  
2509  The lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane
2510  with his coarse fingers.  He had just turned round to say something
2511  when the door opened and Sibyl ran in.
2512  
2513  "How serious you both are!" she cried.  "What is the matter?"
2514  
2515  "Nothing," he answered.  "I suppose one must be serious sometimes.
2516  Good-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o'clock. Everything is
2517  packed, except my shirts, so you need not trouble."
2518  
2519  "Good-bye, my son," she answered with a bow of strained stateliness.
2520  
2521  She was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her, and
2522  there was something in his look that had made her feel afraid.
2523  
2524  "Kiss me, Mother," said the girl.  Her flowerlike lips touched the
2525  withered cheek and warmed its frost.
2526  
2527  "My child! my child!" cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling in
2528  search of an imaginary gallery.
2529  
2530  "Come, Sibyl," said her brother impatiently.  He hated his mother's
2531  affectations.
2532  
2533  They went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and strolled
2534  down the dreary Euston Road.  The passersby glanced in wonder at the
2535  sullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill-fitting clothes, was in the
2536  company of such a graceful, refined-looking girl.  He was like a common
2537  gardener walking with a rose.
2538  
2539  Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of
2540  some stranger.  He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on
2541  geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace.  Sibyl,
2542  however, was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing.  Her
2543  love was trembling in laughter on her lips.  She was thinking of Prince
2544  Charming, and, that she might think of him all the more, she did not
2545  talk of him, but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to
2546  sail, about the gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful
2547  heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked, red-shirted
2548  bushrangers.  For he was not to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or
2549  whatever he was going to be.  Oh, no!  A sailor's existence was
2550  dreadful.  Fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship, with the hoarse,
2551  hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a black wind blowing the masts
2552  down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands!  He was to
2553  leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a polite good-bye to the captain,
2554  and go off at once to the gold-fields. Before a week was over he was to
2555  come across a large nugget of pure gold, the largest nugget that had
2556  ever been discovered, and bring it down to the coast in a waggon
2557  guarded by six mounted policemen.  The bushrangers were to attack them
2558  three times, and be defeated with immense slaughter.  Or, no.  He was
2559  not to go to the gold-fields at all.  They were horrid places, where
2560  men got intoxicated, and shot each other in bar-rooms, and used bad
2561  language.  He was to be a nice sheep-farmer, and one evening, as he was
2562  riding home, he was to see the beautiful heiress being carried off by a
2563  robber on a black horse, and give chase, and rescue her.  Of course,
2564  she would fall in love with him, and he with her, and they would get
2565  married, and come home, and live in an immense house in London.  Yes,
2566  there were delightful things in store for him.  But he must be very
2567  good, and not lose his temper, or spend his money foolishly.  She was
2568  only a year older than he was, but she knew so much more of life.  He
2569  must be sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and to say his
2570  prayers each night before he went to sleep.  God was very good, and
2571  would watch over him.  She would pray for him, too, and in a few years
2572  he would come back quite rich and happy.
2573  
2574  The lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer.  He was heart-sick
2575  at leaving home.
2576  
2577  Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose.
2578  Inexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger
2579  of Sibyl's position.  This young dandy who was making love to her could
2580  mean her no good.  He was a gentleman, and he hated him for that, hated
2581  him through some curious race-instinct for which he could not account,
2582  and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him.  He was
2583  conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother's nature,
2584  and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl's happiness.
2585  Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge
2586  them; sometimes they forgive them.
2587  
2588  His mother!  He had something on his mind to ask of her, something that
2589  he had brooded on for many months of silence.  A chance phrase that he
2590  had heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer that had reached his ears
2591  one night as he waited at the stage-door, had set loose a train of
2592  horrible thoughts.  He remembered it as if it had been the lash of a
2593  hunting-crop across his face.  His brows knit together into a wedge-like
2594  furrow, and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip.
2595  
2596  "You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim," cried Sibyl, "and I
2597  am making the most delightful plans for your future.  Do say something."
2598  
2599  "What do you want me to say?"
2600  
2601  "Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us," she answered,
2602  smiling at him.
2603  
2604  He shrugged his shoulders.  "You are more likely to forget me than I am
2605  to forget you, Sibyl."
2606  
2607  She flushed.  "What do you mean, Jim?" she asked.
2608  
2609  "You have a new friend, I hear.  Who is he?  Why have you not told me
2610  about him?  He means you no good."
2611  
2612  "Stop, Jim!" she exclaimed.  "You must not say anything against him.  I
2613  love him."
2614  
2615  "Why, you don't even know his name," answered the lad.  "Who is he?  I
2616  have a right to know."
2617  
2618  "He is called Prince Charming.  Don't you like the name.  Oh! you silly
2619  boy! you should never forget it.  If you only saw him, you would think
2620  him the most wonderful person in the world.  Some day you will meet
2621  him--when you come back from Australia.  You will like him so much.
2622  Everybody likes him, and I ... love him.  I wish you could come to the
2623  theatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I am to play Juliet.
2624  Oh! how I shall play it!  Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play Juliet!
2625  To have him sitting there!  To play for his delight!  I am afraid I may
2626  frighten the company, frighten or enthrall them.  To be in love is to
2627  surpass one's self.  Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting 'genius'
2628  to his loafers at the bar.  He has preached me as a dogma; to-night he
2629  will announce me as a revelation.  I feel it.  And it is all his, his
2630  only, Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces.  But I am
2631  poor beside him.  Poor?  What does that matter?  When poverty creeps in
2632  at the door, love flies in through the window.  Our proverbs want
2633  rewriting.  They were made in winter, and it is summer now; spring-time
2634  for me, I think, a very dance of blossoms in blue skies."
2635  
2636  "He is a gentleman," said the lad sullenly.
2637  
2638  "A prince!" she cried musically.  "What more do you want?"
2639  
2640  "He wants to enslave you."
2641  
2642  "I shudder at the thought of being free."
2643  
2644  "I want you to beware of him."
2645  
2646  "To see him is to worship him; to know him is to trust him."
2647  
2648  "Sibyl, you are mad about him."
2649  
2650  She laughed and took his arm.  "You dear old Jim, you talk as if you
2651  were a hundred.  Some day you will be in love yourself.  Then you will
2652  know what it is.  Don't look so sulky.  Surely you should be glad to
2653  think that, though you are going away, you leave me happier than I have
2654  ever been before.  Life has been hard for us both, terribly hard and
2655  difficult.  But it will be different now.  You are going to a new
2656  world, and I have found one.  Here are two chairs; let us sit down and
2657  see the smart people go by."
2658  
2659  They took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers.  The tulip-beds
2660  across the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire.  A white
2661  dust--tremulous cloud of orris-root it seemed--hung in the panting air.
2662  The brightly coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous
2663  butterflies.
2664  
2665  She made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects.  He
2666  spoke slowly and with effort.  They passed words to each other as
2667  players at a game pass counters.  Sibyl felt oppressed.  She could not
2668  communicate her joy.  A faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all
2669  the echo she could win.  After some time she became silent.  Suddenly
2670  she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and in an open
2671  carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.
2672  
2673  She started to her feet.  "There he is!" she cried.
2674  
2675  "Who?" said Jim Vane.
2676  
2677  "Prince Charming," she answered, looking after the victoria.
2678  
2679  He jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm.  "Show him to me.
2680  Which is he?  Point him out.  I must see him!" he exclaimed; but at
2681  that moment the Duke of Berwick's four-in-hand came between, and when
2682  it had left the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the park.
2683  
2684  "He is gone," murmured Sibyl sadly.  "I wish you had seen him."
2685  
2686  "I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does
2687  you any wrong, I shall kill him."
2688  
2689  She looked at him in horror.  He repeated his words.  They cut the air
2690  like a dagger.  The people round began to gape.  A lady standing close
2691  to her tittered.
2692  
2693  "Come away, Jim; come away," she whispered.  He followed her doggedly
2694  as she passed through the crowd.  He felt glad at what he had said.
2695  
2696  When they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round.  There was
2697  pity in her eyes that became laughter on her lips.  She shook her head
2698  at him.  "You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy,
2699  that is all.  How can you say such horrible things?  You don't know
2700  what you are talking about.  You are simply jealous and unkind.  Ah!  I
2701  wish you would fall in love.  Love makes people good, and what you said
2702  was wicked."
2703  
2704  "I am sixteen," he answered, "and I know what I am about.  Mother is no
2705  help to you.  She doesn't understand how to look after you.  I wish now
2706  that I was not going to Australia at all.  I have a great mind to chuck
2707  the whole thing up.  I would, if my articles hadn't been signed."
2708  
2709  "Oh, don't be so serious, Jim.  You are like one of the heroes of those
2710  silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in.  I am not
2711  going to quarrel with you.  I have seen him, and oh! to see him is
2712  perfect happiness.  We won't quarrel.  I know you would never harm any
2713  one I love, would you?"
2714  
2715  "Not as long as you love him, I suppose," was the sullen answer.
2716  
2717  "I shall love him for ever!" she cried.
2718  
2719  "And he?"
2720  
2721  "For ever, too!"
2722  
2723  "He had better."
2724  
2725  She shrank from him.  Then she laughed and put her hand on his arm.  He
2726  was merely a boy.
2727  
2728  At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to
2729  their shabby home in the Euston Road.  It was after five o'clock, and
2730  Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting.  Jim
2731  insisted that she should do so.  He said that he would sooner part with
2732  her when their mother was not present.  She would be sure to make a
2733  scene, and he detested scenes of every kind.
2734  
2735  In Sybil's own room they parted.  There was jealousy in the lad's
2736  heart, and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed
2737  to him, had come between them.  Yet, when her arms were flung round his
2738  neck, and her fingers strayed through his hair, he softened and kissed
2739  her with real affection.  There were tears in his eyes as he went
2740  downstairs.
2741  
2742  His mother was waiting for him below.  She grumbled at his
2743  unpunctuality, as he entered.  He made no answer, but sat down to his
2744  meagre meal.  The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the
2745  stained cloth.  Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter of
2746  street-cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that
2747  was left to him.
2748  
2749  After some time, he thrust away his plate and put his head in his
2750  hands.  He felt that he had a right to know.  It should have been told
2751  to him before, if it was as he suspected.  Leaden with fear, his mother
2752  watched him.  Words dropped mechanically from her lips.  A tattered
2753  lace handkerchief twitched in her fingers.  When the clock struck six,
2754  he got up and went to the door.  Then he turned back and looked at her.
2755  Their eyes met.  In hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy.  It enraged
2756  him.
2757  
2758  "Mother, I have something to ask you," he said.  Her eyes wandered
2759  vaguely about the room.  She made no answer.  "Tell me the truth.  I
2760  have a right to know.  Were you married to my father?"
2761  
2762  She heaved a deep sigh.  It was a sigh of relief.  The terrible moment,
2763  the moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she had dreaded,
2764  had come at last, and yet she felt no terror.  Indeed, in some measure
2765  it was a disappointment to her.  The vulgar directness of the question
2766  called for a direct answer.  The situation had not been gradually led
2767  up to.  It was crude.  It reminded her of a bad rehearsal.
2768  
2769  "No," she answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life.
2770  
2771  "My father was a scoundrel then!" cried the lad, clenching his fists.
2772  
2773  She shook her head.  "I knew he was not free.  We loved each other very
2774  much.  If he had lived, he would have made provision for us.  Don't
2775  speak against him, my son.  He was your father, and a gentleman.
2776  Indeed, he was highly connected."
2777  
2778  An oath broke from his lips.  "I don't care for myself," he exclaimed,
2779  "but don't let Sibyl.... It is a gentleman, isn't it, who is in love
2780  with her, or says he is?  Highly connected, too, I suppose."
2781  
2782  For a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman.  Her
2783  head drooped.  She wiped her eyes with shaking hands.  "Sibyl has a
2784  mother," she murmured; "I had none."
2785  
2786  The lad was touched.  He went towards her, and stooping down, he kissed
2787  her.  "I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father," he
2788  said, "but I could not help it.  I must go now.  Good-bye. Don't forget
2789  that you will have only one child now to look after, and believe me
2790  that if this man wrongs my sister, I will find out who he is, track him
2791  down, and kill him like a dog.  I swear it."
2792  
2793  The exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that
2794  accompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivid
2795  to her.  She was familiar with the atmosphere.  She breathed more
2796  freely, and for the first time for many months she really admired her
2797  son.  She would have liked to have continued the scene on the same
2798  emotional scale, but he cut her short.  Trunks had to be carried down
2799  and mufflers looked for.  The lodging-house drudge bustled in and out.
2800  There was the bargaining with the cabman.  The moment was lost in
2801  vulgar details.  It was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that
2802  she waved the tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her son
2803  drove away.  She was conscious that a great opportunity had been
2804  wasted.  She consoled herself by telling Sibyl how desolate she felt
2805  her life would be, now that she had only one child to look after.  She
2806  remembered the phrase.  It had pleased her.  Of the threat she said
2807  nothing.  It was vividly and dramatically expressed.  She felt that
2808  they would all laugh at it some day.
2809  
2810  
2811  
2812  CHAPTER 6
2813  
2814  "I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?" said Lord Henry that
2815  evening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol
2816  where dinner had been laid for three.
2817  
2818  "No, Harry," answered the artist, giving his hat and coat to the bowing
2819  waiter.  "What is it?  Nothing about politics, I hope!  They don't
2820  interest me.  There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons
2821  worth painting, though many of them would be the better for a little
2822  whitewashing."
2823  
2824  "Dorian Gray is engaged to be married," said Lord Henry, watching him
2825  as he spoke.
2826  
2827  Hallward started and then frowned.  "Dorian engaged to be married!" he
2828  cried.  "Impossible!"
2829  
2830  "It is perfectly true."
2831  
2832  "To whom?"
2833  
2834  "To some little actress or other."
2835  
2836  "I can't believe it.  Dorian is far too sensible."
2837  
2838  "Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my dear
2839  Basil."
2840  
2841  "Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry."
2842  
2843  "Except in America," rejoined Lord Henry languidly.  "But I didn't say
2844  he was married.  I said he was engaged to be married.  There is a great
2845  difference.  I have a distinct remembrance of being married, but I have
2846  no recollection at all of being engaged.  I am inclined to think that I
2847  never was engaged."
2848  
2849  "But think of Dorian's birth, and position, and wealth.  It would be
2850  absurd for him to marry so much beneath him."
2851  
2852  "If you want to make him marry this girl, tell him that, Basil.  He is
2853  sure to do it, then.  Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it
2854  is always from the noblest motives."
2855  
2856  "I hope the girl is good, Harry.  I don't want to see Dorian tied to
2857  some vile creature, who might degrade his nature and ruin his
2858  intellect."
2859  
2860  "Oh, she is better than good--she is beautiful," murmured Lord Henry,
2861  sipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. "Dorian says she is
2862  beautiful, and he is not often wrong about things of that kind.  Your
2863  portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal
2864  appearance of other people.  It has had that excellent effect, amongst
2865  others.  We are to see her to-night, if that boy doesn't forget his
2866  appointment."
2867  
2868  "Are you serious?"
2869  
2870  "Quite serious, Basil.  I should be miserable if I thought I should
2871  ever be more serious than I am at the present moment."
2872  
2873  "But do you approve of it, Harry?" asked the painter, walking up and
2874  down the room and biting his lip.  "You can't approve of it, possibly.
2875  It is some silly infatuation."
2876  
2877  "I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now.  It is an absurd
2878  attitude to take towards life.  We are not sent into the world to air
2879  our moral prejudices.  I never take any notice of what common people
2880  say, and I never interfere with what charming people do.  If a
2881  personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality
2882  selects is absolutely delightful to me.  Dorian Gray falls in love with
2883  a beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and proposes to marry her.  Why not?
2884  If he wedded Messalina, he would be none the less interesting.  You
2885  know I am not a champion of marriage.  The real drawback to marriage is
2886  that it makes one unselfish.  And unselfish people are colourless.
2887  They lack individuality.  Still, there are certain temperaments that
2888  marriage makes more complex.  They retain their egotism, and add to it
2889  many other egos.  They are forced to have more than one life.  They
2890  become more highly organized, and to be highly organized is, I should
2891  fancy, the object of man's existence.  Besides, every experience is of
2892  value, and whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an
2893  experience.  I hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife,
2894  passionately adore her for six months, and then suddenly become
2895  fascinated by some one else.  He would be a wonderful study."
2896  
2897  "You don't mean a single word of all that, Harry; you know you don't.
2898  If Dorian Gray's life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier than
2899  yourself.  You are much better than you pretend to be."
2900  
2901  Lord Henry laughed.  "The reason we all like to think so well of others
2902  is that we are all afraid for ourselves.  The basis of optimism is
2903  sheer terror.  We think that we are generous because we credit our
2904  neighbour with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a
2905  benefit to us.  We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account,
2906  and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare
2907  our pockets.  I mean everything that I have said.  I have the greatest
2908  contempt for optimism.  As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but
2909  one whose growth is arrested.  If you want to mar a nature, you have
2910  merely to reform it.  As for marriage, of course that would be silly,
2911  but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women.
2912  I will certainly encourage them.  They have the charm of being
2913  fashionable.  But here is Dorian himself.  He will tell you more than I
2914  can."
2915  
2916  "My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!" said the
2917  lad, throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined wings and
2918  shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn.  "I have never been so
2919  happy.  Of course, it is sudden--all really delightful things are.  And
2920  yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my
2921  life." He was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and looked
2922  extraordinarily handsome.
2923  
2924  "I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian," said Hallward, "but I
2925  don't quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement.
2926  You let Harry know."
2927  
2928  "And I don't forgive you for being late for dinner," broke in Lord
2929  Henry, putting his hand on the lad's shoulder and smiling as he spoke.
2930  "Come, let us sit down and try what the new _chef_ here is like, and then
2931  you will tell us how it all came about."
2932  
2933  "There is really not much to tell," cried Dorian as they took their
2934  seats at the small round table.  "What happened was simply this.  After
2935  I left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at that
2936  little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to, and
2937  went down at eight o'clock to the theatre.  Sibyl was playing Rosalind.
2938  Of course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd.  But Sibyl!
2939  You should have seen her!  When she came on in her boy's clothes, she
2940  was perfectly wonderful.  She wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with
2941  cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross-gartered hose, a dainty little
2942  green cap with a hawk's feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak
2943  lined with dull red.  She had never seemed to me more exquisite.  She
2944  had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in
2945  your studio, Basil.  Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves
2946  round a pale rose.  As for her acting--well, you shall see her
2947  to-night. She is simply a born artist.  I sat in the dingy box
2948  absolutely enthralled.  I forgot that I was in London and in the
2949  nineteenth century.  I was away with my love in a forest that no man
2950  had ever seen.  After the performance was over, I went behind and spoke
2951  to her.  As we were sitting together, suddenly there came into her eyes
2952  a look that I had never seen there before.  My lips moved towards hers.
2953  We kissed each other.  I can't describe to you what I felt at that
2954  moment.  It seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one
2955  perfect point of rose-coloured joy.  She trembled all over and shook
2956  like a white narcissus.  Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed
2957  my hands.  I feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can't help
2958  it.  Of course, our engagement is a dead secret.  She has not even told
2959  her own mother.  I don't know what my guardians will say.  Lord Radley
2960  is sure to be furious.  I don't care.  I shall be of age in less than a
2961  year, and then I can do what I like.  I have been right, Basil, haven't
2962  I, to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare's
2963  plays?  Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their
2964  secret in my ear.  I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and
2965  kissed Juliet on the mouth."
2966  
2967  "Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right," said Hallward slowly.
2968  
2969  "Have you seen her to-day?" asked Lord Henry.
2970  
2971  Dorian Gray shook his head.  "I left her in the forest of Arden; I
2972  shall find her in an orchard in Verona."
2973  
2974  Lord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner.  "At what
2975  particular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian?  And what
2976  did she say in answer?  Perhaps you forgot all about it."
2977  
2978  "My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I did
2979  not make any formal proposal.  I told her that I loved her, and she
2980  said she was not worthy to be my wife.  Not worthy!  Why, the whole
2981  world is nothing to me compared with her."
2982  
2983  "Women are wonderfully practical," murmured Lord Henry, "much more
2984  practical than we are.  In situations of that kind we often forget to
2985  say anything about marriage, and they always remind us."
2986  
2987  Hallward laid his hand upon his arm.  "Don't, Harry.  You have annoyed
2988  Dorian.  He is not like other men.  He would never bring misery upon
2989  any one.  His nature is too fine for that."
2990  
2991  Lord Henry looked across the table.  "Dorian is never annoyed with me,"
2992  he answered.  "I asked the question for the best reason possible, for
2993  the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking any
2994  question--simple curiosity.  I have a theory that it is always the
2995  women who propose to us, and not we who propose to the women.  Except,
2996  of course, in middle-class life.  But then the middle classes are not
2997  modern."
2998  
2999  Dorian Gray laughed, and tossed his head.  "You are quite incorrigible,
3000  Harry; but I don't mind.  It is impossible to be angry with you.  When
3001  you see Sibyl Vane, you will feel that the man who could wrong her
3002  would be a beast, a beast without a heart.  I cannot understand how any
3003  one can wish to shame the thing he loves.  I love Sibyl Vane.  I want
3004  to place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the
3005  woman who is mine.  What is marriage?  An irrevocable vow.  You mock at
3006  it for that.  Ah! don't mock.  It is an irrevocable vow that I want to
3007  take.  Her trust makes me faithful, her belief makes me good.  When I
3008  am with her, I regret all that you have taught me.  I become different
3009  from what you have known me to be.  I am changed, and the mere touch of
3010  Sibyl Vane's hand makes me forget you and all your wrong, fascinating,
3011  poisonous, delightful theories."
3012  
3013  "And those are ...?" asked Lord Henry, helping himself to some salad.
3014  
3015  "Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories
3016  about pleasure.  All your theories, in fact, Harry."
3017  
3018  "Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about," he answered
3019  in his slow melodious voice.  "But I am afraid I cannot claim my theory
3020  as my own.  It belongs to Nature, not to me.  Pleasure is Nature's
3021  test, her sign of approval.  When we are happy, we are always good, but
3022  when we are good, we are not always happy."
3023  
3024  "Ah! but what do you mean by good?" cried Basil Hallward.
3025  
3026  "Yes," echoed Dorian, leaning back in his chair and looking at Lord
3027  Henry over the heavy clusters of purple-lipped irises that stood in the
3028  centre of the table, "what do you mean by good, Harry?"
3029  
3030  "To be good is to be in harmony with one's self," he replied, touching
3031  the thin stem of his glass with his pale, fine-pointed fingers.
3032  "Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others.  One's own
3033  life--that is the important thing.  As for the lives of one's
3034  neighbours, if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt
3035  one's moral views about them, but they are not one's concern.  Besides,
3036  individualism has really the higher aim.  Modern morality consists in
3037  accepting the standard of one's age.  I consider that for any man of
3038  culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest
3039  immorality."
3040  
3041  "But, surely, if one lives merely for one's self, Harry, one pays a
3042  terrible price for doing so?" suggested the painter.
3043  
3044  "Yes, we are overcharged for everything nowadays.  I should fancy that
3045  the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but
3046  self-denial. Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege
3047  of the rich."
3048  
3049  "One has to pay in other ways but money."
3050  
3051  "What sort of ways, Basil?"
3052  
3053  "Oh!  I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in ... well, in the
3054  consciousness of degradation."
3055  
3056  Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.  "My dear fellow, mediaeval art is
3057  charming, but mediaeval emotions are out of date.  One can use them in
3058  fiction, of course.  But then the only things that one can use in
3059  fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact.  Believe me,
3060  no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilized man ever
3061  knows what a pleasure is."
3062  
3063  "I know what pleasure is," cried Dorian Gray.  "It is to adore some
3064  one."
3065  
3066  "That is certainly better than being adored," he answered, toying with
3067  some fruits.  "Being adored is a nuisance.  Women treat us just as
3068  humanity treats its gods.  They worship us, and are always bothering us
3069  to do something for them."
3070  
3071  "I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to
3072  us," murmured the lad gravely.  "They create love in our natures.  They
3073  have a right to demand it back."
3074  
3075  "That is quite true, Dorian," cried Hallward.
3076  
3077  "Nothing is ever quite true," said Lord Henry.
3078  
3079  "This is," interrupted Dorian.  "You must admit, Harry, that women give
3080  to men the very gold of their lives."
3081  
3082  "Possibly," he sighed, "but they invariably want it back in such very
3083  small change.  That is the worry.  Women, as some witty Frenchman once
3084  put it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always
3085  prevent us from carrying them out."
3086  
3087  "Harry, you are dreadful!  I don't know why I like you so much."
3088  
3089  "You will always like me, Dorian," he replied.  "Will you have some
3090  coffee, you fellows?  Waiter, bring coffee, and _fine-champagne_, and
3091  some cigarettes.  No, don't mind the cigarettes--I have some.  Basil, I
3092  can't allow you to smoke cigars.  You must have a cigarette.  A
3093  cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure.  It is exquisite,
3094  and it leaves one unsatisfied.  What more can one want?  Yes, Dorian,
3095  you will always be fond of me.  I represent to you all the sins you
3096  have never had the courage to commit."
3097  
3098  "What nonsense you talk, Harry!" cried the lad, taking a light from a
3099  fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table.
3100  "Let us go down to the theatre.  When Sibyl comes on the stage you will
3101  have a new ideal of life.  She will represent something to you that you
3102  have never known."
3103  
3104  "I have known everything," said Lord Henry, with a tired look in his
3105  eyes, "but I am always ready for a new emotion.  I am afraid, however,
3106  that, for me at any rate, there is no such thing.  Still, your
3107  wonderful girl may thrill me.  I love acting.  It is so much more real
3108  than life.  Let us go.  Dorian, you will come with me.  I am so sorry,
3109  Basil, but there is only room for two in the brougham.  You must follow
3110  us in a hansom."
3111  
3112  They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing.  The
3113  painter was silent and preoccupied.  There was a gloom over him.  He
3114  could not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him to be better
3115  than many other things that might have happened.  After a few minutes,
3116  they all passed downstairs.  He drove off by himself, as had been
3117  arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in
3118  front of him.  A strange sense of loss came over him.  He felt that
3119  Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the
3120  past.  Life had come between them.... His eyes darkened, and the
3121  crowded flaring streets became blurred to his eyes.  When the cab drew
3122  up at the theatre, it seemed to him that he had grown years older.
3123  
3124  
3125  
3126  CHAPTER 7
3127  
3128  For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and the fat
3129  Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with
3130  an oily tremulous smile.  He escorted them to their box with a sort of
3131  pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top
3132  of his voice.  Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever.  He felt as if
3133  he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban.  Lord
3134  Henry, upon the other hand, rather liked him.  At least he declared he
3135  did, and insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he
3136  was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone
3137  bankrupt over a poet.  Hallward amused himself with watching the faces
3138  in the pit.  The heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight
3139  flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire.  The youths
3140  in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them
3141  over the side.  They talked to each other across the theatre and shared
3142  their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them.  Some women
3143  were laughing in the pit.  Their voices were horribly shrill and
3144  discordant.  The sound of the popping of corks came from the bar.
3145  
3146  "What a place to find one's divinity in!" said Lord Henry.
3147  
3148  "Yes!" answered Dorian Gray.  "It was here I found her, and she is
3149  divine beyond all living things.  When she acts, you will forget
3150  everything.  These common rough people, with their coarse faces and
3151  brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage.  They
3152  sit silently and watch her.  They weep and laugh as she wills them to
3153  do.  She makes them as responsive as a violin.  She spiritualizes them,
3154  and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one's self."
3155  
3156  "The same flesh and blood as one's self!  Oh, I hope not!" exclaimed
3157  Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his
3158  opera-glass.
3159  
3160  "Don't pay any attention to him, Dorian," said the painter.  "I
3161  understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl.  Any one you love
3162  must be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you describe must
3163  be fine and noble.  To spiritualize one's age--that is something worth
3164  doing.  If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without
3165  one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have
3166  been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and
3167  lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she is worthy of
3168  all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world.  This
3169  marriage is quite right.  I did not think so at first, but I admit it
3170  now.  The gods made Sibyl Vane for you.  Without her you would have
3171  been incomplete."
3172  
3173  "Thanks, Basil," answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand.  "I knew that
3174  you would understand me.  Harry is so cynical, he terrifies me.  But
3175  here is the orchestra.  It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for
3176  about five minutes.  Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl
3177  to whom I am going to give all my life, to whom I have given everything
3178  that is good in me."
3179  
3180  A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of
3181  applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage.  Yes, she was certainly
3182  lovely to look at--one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought,
3183  that he had ever seen.  There was something of the fawn in her shy
3184  grace and startled eyes.  A faint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a
3185  mirror of silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded
3186  enthusiastic house.  She stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed
3187  to tremble.  Basil Hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud.
3188  Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat Dorian Gray, gazing at her.
3189  Lord Henry peered through his glasses, murmuring, "Charming! charming!"
3190  
3191  The scene was the hall of Capulet's house, and Romeo in his pilgrim's
3192  dress had entered with Mercutio and his other friends.  The band, such
3193  as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began.  Through
3194  the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a
3195  creature from a finer world.  Her body swayed, while she danced, as a
3196  plant sways in the water.  The curves of her throat were the curves of
3197  a white lily.  Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.
3198  
3199  Yet she was curiously listless.  She showed no sign of joy when her
3200  eyes rested on Romeo.  The few words she had to speak--
3201  
3202      Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
3203          Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
3204      For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
3205          And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss--
3206  
3207  with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly
3208  artificial manner.  The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view
3209  of tone it was absolutely false.  It was wrong in colour.  It took away
3210  all the life from the verse.  It made the passion unreal.
3211  
3212  Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her.  He was puzzled and anxious.
3213  Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him.  She seemed to
3214  them to be absolutely incompetent.  They were horribly disappointed.
3215  
3216  Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of
3217  the second act.  They waited for that.  If she failed there, there was
3218  nothing in her.
3219  
3220  She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight.  That could not
3221  be denied.  But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew
3222  worse as she went on.  Her gestures became absurdly artificial.  She
3223  overemphasized everything that she had to say.  The beautiful passage--
3224  
3225      Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
3226      Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
3227      For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night--
3228  
3229  was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been
3230  taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution. When she
3231  leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines--
3232  
3233          Although I joy in thee,
3234      I have no joy of this contract to-night:
3235      It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
3236      Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
3237      Ere one can say, "It lightens."  Sweet, good-night!
3238      This bud of love by summer's ripening breath
3239      May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet--
3240  
3241  she spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her. It was
3242  not nervousness. Indeed, so far from being nervous, she was absolutely
3243  self-contained. It was simply bad art. She was a complete failure.
3244  
3245  Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their
3246  interest in the play. They got restless, and began to talk loudly and
3247  to whistle. The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the
3248  dress-circle, stamped and swore with rage. The only person unmoved was
3249  the girl herself.
3250  
3251  When the second act was over, there came a storm of hisses, and Lord
3252  Henry got up from his chair and put on his coat.  "She is quite
3253  beautiful, Dorian," he said, "but she can't act.  Let us go."
3254  
3255  "I am going to see the play through," answered the lad, in a hard
3256  bitter voice.  "I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an
3257  evening, Harry.  I apologize to you both."
3258  
3259  "My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill," interrupted
3260  Hallward.  "We will come some other night."
3261  
3262  "I wish she were ill," he rejoined.  "But she seems to me to be simply
3263  callous and cold.  She has entirely altered.  Last night she was a
3264  great artist.  This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre
3265  actress."
3266  
3267  "Don't talk like that about any one you love, Dorian.  Love is a more
3268  wonderful thing than art."
3269  
3270  "They are both simply forms of imitation," remarked Lord Henry.  "But
3271  do let us go.  Dorian, you must not stay here any longer.  It is not
3272  good for one's morals to see bad acting.  Besides, I don't suppose you
3273  will want your wife to act, so what does it matter if she plays Juliet
3274  like a wooden doll?  She is very lovely, and if she knows as little
3275  about life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful
3276  experience.  There are only two kinds of people who are really
3277  fascinating--people who know absolutely everything, and people who know
3278  absolutely nothing.  Good heavens, my dear boy, don't look so tragic!
3279  The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is
3280  unbecoming.  Come to the club with Basil and myself.  We will smoke
3281  cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane.  She is beautiful.
3282  What more can you want?"
3283  
3284  "Go away, Harry," cried the lad.  "I want to be alone.  Basil, you must
3285  go.  Ah! can't you see that my heart is breaking?"  The hot tears came
3286  to his eyes.  His lips trembled, and rushing to the back of the box, he
3287  leaned up against the wall, hiding his face in his hands.
3288  
3289  "Let us go, Basil," said Lord Henry with a strange tenderness in his
3290  voice, and the two young men passed out together.
3291  
3292  A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose
3293  on the third act.  Dorian Gray went back to his seat.  He looked pale,
3294  and proud, and indifferent.  The play dragged on, and seemed
3295  interminable.  Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy boots
3296  and laughing.  The whole thing was a _fiasco_.  The last act was played
3297  to almost empty benches.  The curtain went down on a titter and some
3298  groans.
3299  
3300  As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the
3301  greenroom.  The girl was standing there alone, with a look of triumph
3302  on her face.  Her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire.  There was a
3303  radiance about her.  Her parted lips were smiling over some secret of
3304  their own.
3305  
3306  When he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of infinite joy
3307  came over her.  "How badly I acted to-night, Dorian!" she cried.
3308  
3309  "Horribly!" he answered, gazing at her in amazement.  "Horribly!  It
3310  was dreadful.  Are you ill?  You have no idea what it was.  You have no
3311  idea what I suffered."
3312  
3313  The girl smiled.  "Dorian," she answered, lingering over his name with
3314  long-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than honey to
3315  the red petals of her mouth.  "Dorian, you should have understood.  But
3316  you understand now, don't you?"
3317  
3318  "Understand what?" he asked, angrily.
3319  
3320  "Why I was so bad to-night. Why I shall always be bad.  Why I shall
3321  never act well again."
3322  
3323  He shrugged his shoulders.  "You are ill, I suppose.  When you are ill
3324  you shouldn't act.  You make yourself ridiculous.  My friends were
3325  bored.  I was bored."
3326  
3327  She seemed not to listen to him.  She was transfigured with joy.  An
3328  ecstasy of happiness dominated her.
3329  
3330  "Dorian, Dorian," she cried, "before I knew you, acting was the one
3331  reality of my life.  It was only in the theatre that I lived.  I
3332  thought that it was all true.  I was Rosalind one night and Portia the
3333  other.  The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia
3334  were mine also.  I believed in everything.  The common people who acted
3335  with me seemed to me to be godlike.  The painted scenes were my world.
3336  I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought them real.  You came--oh, my
3337  beautiful love!--and you freed my soul from prison.  You taught me what
3338  reality really is.  To-night, for the first time in my life, I saw
3339  through the hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant in
3340  which I had always played.  To-night, for the first time, I became
3341  conscious that the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the
3342  moonlight in the orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and
3343  that the words I had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not
3344  what I wanted to say.  You had brought me something higher, something
3345  of which all art is but a reflection.  You had made me understand what
3346  love really is.  My love!  My love!  Prince Charming!  Prince of life!
3347  I have grown sick of shadows.  You are more to me than all art can ever
3348  be.  What have I to do with the puppets of a play?  When I came on
3349  to-night, I could not understand how it was that everything had gone
3350  from me.  I thought that I was going to be wonderful.  I found that I
3351  could do nothing.  Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant.
3352  The knowledge was exquisite to me.  I heard them hissing, and I smiled.
3353  What could they know of love such as ours?  Take me away, Dorian--take
3354  me away with you, where we can be quite alone.  I hate the stage.  I
3355  might mimic a passion that I do not feel, but I cannot mimic one that
3356  burns me like fire.  Oh, Dorian, Dorian, you understand now what it
3357  signifies?  Even if I could do it, it would be profanation for me to
3358  play at being in love.  You have made me see that."
3359  
3360  He flung himself down on the sofa and turned away his face.  "You have
3361  killed my love," he muttered.
3362  
3363  She looked at him in wonder and laughed.  He made no answer.  She came
3364  across to him, and with her little fingers stroked his hair.  She knelt
3365  down and pressed his hands to her lips.  He drew them away, and a
3366  shudder ran through him.
3367  
3368  Then he leaped up and went to the door.  "Yes," he cried, "you have
3369  killed my love.  You used to stir my imagination.  Now you don't even
3370  stir my curiosity.  You simply produce no effect.  I loved you because
3371  you were marvellous, because you had genius and intellect, because you
3372  realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the
3373  shadows of art.  You have thrown it all away.  You are shallow and
3374  stupid.  My God! how mad I was to love you!  What a fool I have been!
3375  You are nothing to me now.  I will never see you again.  I will never
3376  think of you.  I will never mention your name.  You don't know what you
3377  were to me, once.  Why, once ... Oh, I can't bear to think of it!  I
3378  wish I had never laid eyes upon you!  You have spoiled the romance of
3379  my life.  How little you can know of love, if you say it mars your art!
3380  Without your art, you are nothing.  I would have made you famous,
3381  splendid, magnificent.  The world would have worshipped you, and you
3382  would have borne my name.  What are you now?  A third-rate actress with
3383  a pretty face."
3384  
3385  The girl grew white, and trembled.  She clenched her hands together,
3386  and her voice seemed to catch in her throat.  "You are not serious,
3387  Dorian?" she murmured.  "You are acting."
3388  
3389  "Acting!  I leave that to you.  You do it so well," he answered
3390  bitterly.
3391  
3392  She rose from her knees and, with a piteous expression of pain in her
3393  face, came across the room to him.  She put her hand upon his arm and
3394  looked into his eyes.  He thrust her back.  "Don't touch me!" he cried.
3395  
3396  A low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet and lay
3397  there like a trampled flower.  "Dorian, Dorian, don't leave me!" she
3398  whispered.  "I am so sorry I didn't act well.  I was thinking of you
3399  all the time.  But I will try--indeed, I will try.  It came so suddenly
3400  across me, my love for you.  I think I should never have known it if
3401  you had not kissed me--if we had not kissed each other.  Kiss me again,
3402  my love.  Don't go away from me.  I couldn't bear it.  Oh! don't go
3403  away from me.  My brother ... No; never mind.  He didn't mean it.  He
3404  was in jest.... But you, oh! can't you forgive me for to-night? I will
3405  work so hard and try to improve.  Don't be cruel to me, because I love
3406  you better than anything in the world.  After all, it is only once that
3407  I have not pleased you.  But you are quite right, Dorian.  I should
3408  have shown myself more of an artist.  It was foolish of me, and yet I
3409  couldn't help it.  Oh, don't leave me, don't leave me." A fit of
3410  passionate sobbing choked her.  She crouched on the floor like a
3411  wounded thing, and Dorian Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at
3412  her, and his chiselled lips curled in exquisite disdain.  There is
3413  always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has
3414  ceased to love.  Sibyl Vane seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic.
3415  Her tears and sobs annoyed him.
3416  
3417  "I am going," he said at last in his calm clear voice.  "I don't wish
3418  to be unkind, but I can't see you again.  You have disappointed me."
3419  
3420  She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer.  Her little
3421  hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him.  He
3422  turned on his heel and left the room.  In a few moments he was out of
3423  the theatre.
3424  
3425  Where he went to he hardly knew.  He remembered wandering through dimly
3426  lit streets, past gaunt, black-shadowed archways and evil-looking
3427  houses.  Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after
3428  him.  Drunkards had reeled by, cursing and chattering to themselves
3429  like monstrous apes.  He had seen grotesque children huddled upon
3430  door-steps, and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.
3431  
3432  As the dawn was just breaking, he found himself close to Covent Garden.
3433  The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed
3434  itself into a perfect pearl.  Huge carts filled with nodding lilies
3435  rumbled slowly down the polished empty street.  The air was heavy with
3436  the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an
3437  anodyne for his pain.  He followed into the market and watched the men
3438  unloading their waggons.  A white-smocked carter offered him some
3439  cherries.  He thanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money
3440  for them, and began to eat them listlessly.  They had been plucked at
3441  midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them.  A long
3442  line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red
3443  roses, defiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge,
3444  jade-green piles of vegetables.  Under the portico, with its grey,
3445  sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls,
3446  waiting for the auction to be over.  Others crowded round the swinging
3447  doors of the coffee-house in the piazza.  The heavy cart-horses slipped
3448  and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings.
3449  Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks.  Iris-necked
3450  and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.
3451  
3452  After a little while, he hailed a hansom and drove home.  For a few
3453  moments he loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent
3454  square, with its blank, close-shuttered windows and its staring blinds.
3455  The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like
3456  silver against it.  From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke
3457  was rising.  It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air.
3458  
3459  In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge's barge, that
3460  hung from the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance,
3461  lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals
3462  of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire.  He turned them out and,
3463  having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the library
3464  towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the
3465  ground floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had just had
3466  decorated for himself and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries
3467  that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby Royal.  As
3468  he was turning the handle of the door, his eye fell upon the portrait
3469  Basil Hallward had painted of him.  He started back as if in surprise.
3470  Then he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled.  After he
3471  had taken the button-hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate.
3472  Finally, he came back, went over to the picture, and examined it.  In
3473  the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk
3474  blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed.  The
3475  expression looked different.  One would have said that there was a
3476  touch of cruelty in the mouth.  It was certainly strange.
3477  
3478  He turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind.  The
3479  bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky
3480  corners, where they lay shuddering.  But the strange expression that he
3481  had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be
3482  more intensified even.  The quivering ardent sunlight showed him the
3483  lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking
3484  into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.
3485  
3486  He winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory
3487  Cupids, one of Lord Henry's many presents to him, glanced hurriedly
3488  into its polished depths.  No line like that warped his red lips.  What
3489  did it mean?
3490  
3491  He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it
3492  again.  There were no signs of any change when he looked into the
3493  actual painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression
3494  had altered.  It was not a mere fancy of his own.  The thing was
3495  horribly apparent.
3496  
3497  He threw himself into a chair and began to think.  Suddenly there
3498  flashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward's studio the
3499  day the picture had been finished.  Yes, he remembered it perfectly.
3500  He had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young, and the
3501  portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the
3502  face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that
3503  the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and
3504  thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness
3505  of his then just conscious boyhood.  Surely his wish had not been
3506  fulfilled?  Such things were impossible.  It seemed monstrous even to
3507  think of them.  And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the
3508  touch of cruelty in the mouth.
3509  
3510  Cruelty!  Had he been cruel?  It was the girl's fault, not his.  He had
3511  dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he
3512  had thought her great.  Then she had disappointed him.  She had been
3513  shallow and unworthy.  And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over
3514  him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little
3515  child.  He remembered with what callousness he had watched her.  Why
3516  had he been made like that?  Why had such a soul been given to him?
3517  But he had suffered also.  During the three terrible hours that the
3518  play had lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of
3519  torture.  His life was well worth hers.  She had marred him for a
3520  moment, if he had wounded her for an age.  Besides, women were better
3521  suited to bear sorrow than men.  They lived on their emotions.  They
3522  only thought of their emotions.  When they took lovers, it was merely
3523  to have some one with whom they could have scenes.  Lord Henry had told
3524  him that, and Lord Henry knew what women were.  Why should he trouble
3525  about Sibyl Vane?  She was nothing to him now.
3526  
3527  But the picture?  What was he to say of that?  It held the secret of
3528  his life, and told his story.  It had taught him to love his own
3529  beauty.  Would it teach him to loathe his own soul?  Would he ever look
3530  at it again?
3531  
3532  No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses.  The
3533  horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it.
3534  Suddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that
3535  makes men mad.  The picture had not changed.  It was folly to think so.
3536  
3537  Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel
3538  smile.  Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight.  Its blue eyes
3539  met his own.  A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the
3540  painted image of himself, came over him.  It had altered already, and
3541  would alter more.  Its gold would wither into grey.  Its red and white
3542  roses would die.  For every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck
3543  and wreck its fairness.  But he would not sin.  The picture, changed or
3544  unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience.  He would
3545  resist temptation.  He would not see Lord Henry any more--would not, at
3546  any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil
3547  Hallward's garden had first stirred within him the passion for
3548  impossible things.  He would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends,
3549  marry her, try to love her again.  Yes, it was his duty to do so.  She
3550  must have suffered more than he had.  Poor child!  He had been selfish
3551  and cruel to her.  The fascination that she had exercised over him
3552  would return.  They would be happy together.  His life with her would
3553  be beautiful and pure.
3554  
3555  He got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the
3556  portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it.  "How horrible!" he murmured
3557  to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it.  When he
3558  stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath.  The fresh morning
3559  air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions.  He thought only of
3560  Sibyl.  A faint echo of his love came back to him.  He repeated her
3561  name over and over again.  The birds that were singing in the
3562  dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her.
3563  
3564  
3565  
3566  CHAPTER 8
3567  
3568  It was long past noon when he awoke.  His valet had crept several times
3569  on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring, and had wondered
3570  what made his young master sleep so late.  Finally his bell sounded,
3571  and Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on
3572  a small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the olive-satin
3573  curtains, with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the
3574  three tall windows.
3575  
3576  "Monsieur has well slept this morning," he said, smiling.
3577  
3578  "What o'clock is it, Victor?" asked Dorian Gray drowsily.
3579  
3580  "One hour and a quarter, Monsieur."
3581  
3582  How late it was!  He sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned over
3583  his letters.  One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by
3584  hand that morning.  He hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside.
3585  The others he opened listlessly.  They contained the usual collection
3586  of cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes
3587  of charity concerts, and the like that are showered on fashionable
3588  young men every morning during the season.  There was a rather heavy
3589  bill for a chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set that he had not yet
3590  had the courage to send on to his guardians, who were extremely
3591  old-fashioned people and did not realize that we live in an age when
3592  unnecessary things are our only necessities; and there were several
3593  very courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders
3594  offering to advance any sum of money at a moment's notice and at the
3595  most reasonable rates of interest.
3596  
3597  After about ten minutes he got up, and throwing on an elaborate
3598  dressing-gown of silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the
3599  onyx-paved bathroom.  The cool water refreshed him after his long
3600  sleep.  He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through.  A
3601  dim sense of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once
3602  or twice, but there was the unreality of a dream about it.
3603  
3604  As soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a
3605  light French breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round
3606  table close to the open window.  It was an exquisite day.  The warm air
3607  seemed laden with spices.  A bee flew in and buzzed round the
3608  blue-dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, stood before
3609  him.  He felt perfectly happy.
3610  
3611  Suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the
3612  portrait, and he started.
3613  
3614  "Too cold for Monsieur?" asked his valet, putting an omelette on the
3615  table.  "I shut the window?"
3616  
3617  Dorian shook his head.  "I am not cold," he murmured.
3618  
3619  Was it all true?  Had the portrait really changed?  Or had it been
3620  simply his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where
3621  there had been a look of joy?  Surely a painted canvas could not alter?
3622  The thing was absurd.  It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day.
3623  It would make him smile.
3624  
3625  And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing!  First in
3626  the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of
3627  cruelty round the warped lips.  He almost dreaded his valet leaving the
3628  room.  He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the
3629  portrait.  He was afraid of certainty.  When the coffee and cigarettes
3630  had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a wild desire to
3631  tell him to remain.  As the door was closing behind him, he called him
3632  back.  The man stood waiting for his orders.  Dorian looked at him for
3633  a moment.  "I am not at home to any one, Victor," he said with a sigh.
3634  The man bowed and retired.
3635  
3636  Then he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on
3637  a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen.  The screen
3638  was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a
3639  rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern.  He scanned it curiously,
3640  wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man's life.
3641  
3642  Should he move it aside, after all?  Why not let it stay there?  What
3643  was the use of knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible.  If it
3644  was not true, why trouble about it?  But what if, by some fate or
3645  deadlier chance, eyes other than his spied behind and saw the horrible
3646  change?  What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at
3647  his own picture?  Basil would be sure to do that.  No; the thing had to
3648  be examined, and at once.  Anything would be better than this dreadful
3649  state of doubt.
3650  
3651  He got up and locked both doors.  At least he would be alone when he
3652  looked upon the mask of his shame.  Then he drew the screen aside and
3653  saw himself face to face.  It was perfectly true.  The portrait had
3654  altered.
3655  
3656  As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he
3657  found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost
3658  scientific interest.  That such a change should have taken place was
3659  incredible to him.  And yet it was a fact.  Was there some subtle
3660  affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form
3661  and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him?  Could it be
3662  that what that soul thought, they realized?--that what it dreamed, they
3663  made true?  Or was there some other, more terrible reason?  He
3664  shuddered, and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there,
3665  gazing at the picture in sickened horror.
3666  
3667  One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him.  It had made him
3668  conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane.  It was not
3669  too late to make reparation for that.  She could still be his wife.
3670  His unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would
3671  be transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil
3672  Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would
3673  be to him what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the
3674  fear of God to us all.  There were opiates for remorse, drugs that
3675  could lull the moral sense to sleep.  But here was a visible symbol of
3676  the degradation of sin.  Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men
3677  brought upon their souls.
3678  
3679  Three o'clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double
3680  chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir.  He was trying to gather up the
3681  scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to find his
3682  way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was
3683  wandering.  He did not know what to do, or what to think.  Finally, he
3684  went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had
3685  loved, imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness.  He
3686  covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of
3687  pain.  There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we
3688  feel that no one else has a right to blame us.  It is the confession,
3689  not the priest, that gives us absolution.  When Dorian had finished the
3690  letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.
3691  
3692  Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henry's
3693  voice outside.  "My dear boy, I must see you.  Let me in at once.  I
3694  can't bear your shutting yourself up like this."
3695  
3696  He made no answer at first, but remained quite still.  The knocking
3697  still continued and grew louder.  Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry
3698  in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead, to quarrel
3699  with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was
3700  inevitable.  He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the picture,
3701  and unlocked the door.
3702  
3703  "I am so sorry for it all, Dorian," said Lord Henry as he entered.
3704  "But you must not think too much about it."
3705  
3706  "Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?" asked the lad.
3707  
3708  "Yes, of course," answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair and slowly
3709  pulling off his yellow gloves.  "It is dreadful, from one point of
3710  view, but it was not your fault.  Tell me, did you go behind and see
3711  her, after the play was over?"
3712  
3713  "Yes."
3714  
3715  "I felt sure you had.  Did you make a scene with her?"
3716  
3717  "I was brutal, Harry--perfectly brutal.  But it is all right now.  I am
3718  not sorry for anything that has happened.  It has taught me to know
3719  myself better."
3720  
3721  "Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way!  I was afraid I
3722  would find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of
3723  yours."
3724  
3725  "I have got through all that," said Dorian, shaking his head and
3726  smiling.  "I am perfectly happy now.  I know what conscience is, to
3727  begin with.  It is not what you told me it was.  It is the divinest
3728  thing in us.  Don't sneer at it, Harry, any more--at least not before
3729  me.  I want to be good.  I can't bear the idea of my soul being
3730  hideous."
3731  
3732  "A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian!  I congratulate you
3733  on it.  But how are you going to begin?"
3734  
3735  "By marrying Sibyl Vane."
3736  
3737  "Marrying Sibyl Vane!" cried Lord Henry, standing up and looking at him
3738  in perplexed amazement.  "But, my dear Dorian--"
3739  
3740  "Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say.  Something dreadful
3741  about marriage.  Don't say it.  Don't ever say things of that kind to
3742  me again.  Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me.  I am not going to
3743  break my word to her.  She is to be my wife."
3744  
3745  "Your wife!  Dorian! ... Didn't you get my letter?  I wrote to you this
3746  morning, and sent the note down by my own man."
3747  
3748  "Your letter?  Oh, yes, I remember.  I have not read it yet, Harry.  I
3749  was afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn't like.  You
3750  cut life to pieces with your epigrams."
3751  
3752  "You know nothing then?"
3753  
3754  "What do you mean?"
3755  
3756  Lord Henry walked across the room, and sitting down by Dorian Gray,
3757  took both his hands in his own and held them tightly.  "Dorian," he
3758  said, "my letter--don't be frightened--was to tell you that Sibyl Vane
3759  is dead."
3760  
3761  A cry of pain broke from the lad's lips, and he leaped to his feet,
3762  tearing his hands away from Lord Henry's grasp.  "Dead!  Sibyl dead!
3763  It is not true!  It is a horrible lie!  How dare you say it?"
3764  
3765  "It is quite true, Dorian," said Lord Henry, gravely.  "It is in all
3766  the morning papers.  I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one
3767  till I came.  There will have to be an inquest, of course, and you must
3768  not be mixed up in it.  Things like that make a man fashionable in
3769  Paris.  But in London people are so prejudiced.  Here, one should never
3770  make one's _debut_ with a scandal.  One should reserve that to give an
3771  interest to one's old age.  I suppose they don't know your name at the
3772  theatre?  If they don't, it is all right.  Did any one see you going
3773  round to her room?  That is an important point."
3774  
3775  Dorian did not answer for a few moments.  He was dazed with horror.
3776  Finally he stammered, in a stifled voice, "Harry, did you say an
3777  inquest?  What did you mean by that?  Did Sibyl--? Oh, Harry, I can't
3778  bear it!  But be quick.  Tell me everything at once."
3779  
3780  "I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be put
3781  in that way to the public.  It seems that as she was leaving the
3782  theatre with her mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she had
3783  forgotten something upstairs.  They waited some time for her, but she
3784  did not come down again.  They ultimately found her lying dead on the
3785  floor of her dressing-room. She had swallowed something by mistake,
3786  some dreadful thing they use at theatres.  I don't know what it was,
3787  but it had either prussic acid or white lead in it.  I should fancy it
3788  was prussic acid, as she seems to have died instantaneously."
3789  
3790  "Harry, Harry, it is terrible!" cried the lad.
3791  
3792  "Yes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed
3793  up in it.  I see by _The Standard_ that she was seventeen.  I should have
3794  thought she was almost younger than that.  She looked such a child, and
3795  seemed to know so little about acting.  Dorian, you mustn't let this
3796  thing get on your nerves.  You must come and dine with me, and
3797  afterwards we will look in at the opera.  It is a Patti night, and
3798  everybody will be there.  You can come to my sister's box.  She has got
3799  some smart women with her."
3800  
3801  "So I have murdered Sibyl Vane," said Dorian Gray, half to himself,
3802  "murdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife.
3803  Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that.  The birds sing just as
3804  happily in my garden.  And to-night I am to dine with you, and then go
3805  on to the opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose, afterwards.  How
3806  extraordinarily dramatic life is!  If I had read all this in a book,
3807  Harry, I think I would have wept over it.  Somehow, now that it has
3808  happened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful for tears.
3809  Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my
3810  life.  Strange, that my first passionate love-letter should have been
3811  addressed to a dead girl.  Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent
3812  people we call the dead?  Sibyl!  Can she feel, or know, or listen?
3813  Oh, Harry, how I loved her once!  It seems years ago to me now.  She
3814  was everything to me.  Then came that dreadful night--was it really
3815  only last night?--when she played so badly, and my heart almost broke.
3816  She explained it all to me.  It was terribly pathetic.  But I was not
3817  moved a bit.  I thought her shallow.  Suddenly something happened that
3818  made me afraid.  I can't tell you what it was, but it was terrible.  I
3819  said I would go back to her.  I felt I had done wrong.  And now she is
3820  dead.  My God!  My God!  Harry, what shall I do?  You don't know the
3821  danger I am in, and there is nothing to keep me straight.  She would
3822  have done that for me.  She had no right to kill herself.  It was
3823  selfish of her."
3824  
3825  "My dear Dorian," answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his case
3826  and producing a gold-latten matchbox, "the only way a woman can ever
3827  reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible
3828  interest in life.  If you had married this girl, you would have been
3829  wretched.  Of course, you would have treated her kindly.  One can
3830  always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing.  But she would
3831  have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her.  And
3832  when a woman finds that out about her husband, she either becomes
3833  dreadfully dowdy, or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman's
3834  husband has to pay for.  I say nothing about the social mistake, which
3835  would have been abject--which, of course, I would not have allowed--but
3836  I assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an
3837  absolute failure."
3838  
3839  "I suppose it would," muttered the lad, walking up and down the room
3840  and looking horribly pale.  "But I thought it was my duty.  It is not
3841  my fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was
3842  right.  I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good
3843  resolutions--that they are always made too late.  Mine certainly were."
3844  
3845  "Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific
3846  laws.  Their origin is pure vanity.  Their result is absolutely _nil_.
3847  They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions
3848  that have a certain charm for the weak.  That is all that can be said
3849  for them.  They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they
3850  have no account."
3851  
3852  "Harry," cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him,
3853  "why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to?  I
3854  don't think I am heartless.  Do you?"
3855  
3856  "You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be
3857  entitled to give yourself that name, Dorian," answered Lord Henry with
3858  his sweet melancholy smile.
3859  
3860  The lad frowned.  "I don't like that explanation, Harry," he rejoined,
3861  "but I am glad you don't think I am heartless.  I am nothing of the
3862  kind.  I know I am not.  And yet I must admit that this thing that has
3863  happened does not affect me as it should.  It seems to me to be simply
3864  like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play.  It has all the terrible
3865  beauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy in which I took a great part, but
3866  by which I have not been wounded."
3867  
3868  "It is an interesting question," said Lord Henry, who found an
3869  exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad's unconscious egotism, "an
3870  extremely interesting question.  I fancy that the true explanation is
3871  this:  It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such
3872  an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their
3873  absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack
3874  of style.  They affect us just as vulgarity affects us.  They give us
3875  an impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that.
3876  Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of
3877  beauty crosses our lives.  If these elements of beauty are real, the
3878  whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect.  Suddenly
3879  we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the
3880  play.  Or rather we are both.  We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder
3881  of the spectacle enthralls us.  In the present case, what is it that
3882  has really happened?  Some one has killed herself for love of you.  I
3883  wish that I had ever had such an experience.  It would have made me in
3884  love with love for the rest of my life.  The people who have adored
3885  me--there have not been very many, but there have been some--have
3886  always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care for them,
3887  or they to care for me.  They have become stout and tedious, and when I
3888  meet them, they go in at once for reminiscences.  That awful memory of
3889  woman!  What a fearful thing it is!  And what an utter intellectual
3890  stagnation it reveals!  One should absorb the colour of life, but one
3891  should never remember its details.  Details are always vulgar."
3892  
3893  "I must sow poppies in my garden," sighed Dorian.
3894  
3895  "There is no necessity," rejoined his companion.  "Life has always
3896  poppies in her hands.  Of course, now and then things linger.  I once
3897  wore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artistic
3898  mourning for a romance that would not die.  Ultimately, however, it did
3899  die.  I forget what killed it.  I think it was her proposing to
3900  sacrifice the whole world for me.  That is always a dreadful moment.
3901  It fills one with the terror of eternity.  Well--would you believe
3902  it?--a week ago, at Lady Hampshire's, I found myself seated at dinner
3903  next the lady in question, and she insisted on going over the whole
3904  thing again, and digging up the past, and raking up the future.  I had
3905  buried my romance in a bed of asphodel.  She dragged it out again and
3906  assured me that I had spoiled her life.  I am bound to state that she
3907  ate an enormous dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety.  But what a lack
3908  of taste she showed!  The one charm of the past is that it is the past.
3909  But women never know when the curtain has fallen.  They always want a
3910  sixth act, and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over,
3911  they propose to continue it.  If they were allowed their own way, every
3912  comedy would have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in
3913  a farce.  They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of
3914  art.  You are more fortunate than I am.  I assure you, Dorian, that not
3915  one of the women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane
3916  did for you.  Ordinary women always console themselves.  Some of them
3917  do it by going in for sentimental colours.  Never trust a woman who
3918  wears mauve, whatever her age may be, or a woman over thirty-five who
3919  is fond of pink ribbons.  It always means that they have a history.
3920  Others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good
3921  qualities of their husbands.  They flaunt their conjugal felicity in
3922  one's face, as if it were the most fascinating of sins.  Religion
3923  consoles some.  Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a
3924  woman once told me, and I can quite understand it.  Besides, nothing
3925  makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner.  Conscience makes
3926  egotists of us all.  Yes; there is really no end to the consolations
3927  that women find in modern life.  Indeed, I have not mentioned the most
3928  important one."
3929  
3930  "What is that, Harry?" said the lad listlessly.
3931  
3932  "Oh, the obvious consolation.  Taking some one else's admirer when one
3933  loses one's own.  In good society that always whitewashes a woman.  But
3934  really, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the
3935  women one meets!  There is something to me quite beautiful about her
3936  death.  I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen.
3937  They make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with,
3938  such as romance, passion, and love."
3939  
3940  "I was terribly cruel to her.  You forget that."
3941  
3942  "I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty, more
3943  than anything else.  They have wonderfully primitive instincts.  We
3944  have emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their
3945  masters, all the same.  They love being dominated.  I am sure you were
3946  splendid.  I have never seen you really and absolutely angry, but I can
3947  fancy how delightful you looked.  And, after all, you said something to
3948  me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely
3949  fanciful, but that I see now was absolutely true, and it holds the key
3950  to everything."
3951  
3952  "What was that, Harry?"
3953  
3954  "You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of
3955  romance--that she was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the other; that
3956  if she died as Juliet, she came to life as Imogen."
3957  
3958  "She will never come to life again now," muttered the lad, burying his
3959  face in his hands.
3960  
3961  "No, she will never come to life.  She has played her last part.  But
3962  you must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room simply
3963  as a strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a wonderful
3964  scene from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur.  The girl never really
3965  lived, and so she has never really died.  To you at least she was
3966  always a dream, a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare's plays and
3967  left them lovelier for its presence, a reed through which Shakespeare's
3968  music sounded richer and more full of joy.  The moment she touched
3969  actual life, she marred it, and it marred her, and so she passed away.
3970  Mourn for Ophelia, if you like.  Put ashes on your head because
3971  Cordelia was strangled.  Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of
3972  Brabantio died.  But don't waste your tears over Sibyl Vane.  She was
3973  less real than they are."
3974  
3975  There was a silence.  The evening darkened in the room.  Noiselessly,
3976  and with silver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden.  The
3977  colours faded wearily out of things.
3978  
3979  After some time Dorian Gray looked up.  "You have explained me to
3980  myself, Harry," he murmured with something of a sigh of relief.  "I
3981  felt all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I
3982  could not express it to myself.  How well you know me!  But we will not
3983  talk again of what has happened.  It has been a marvellous experience.
3984  That is all.  I wonder if life has still in store for me anything as
3985  marvellous."
3986  
3987  "Life has everything in store for you, Dorian.  There is nothing that
3988  you, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do."
3989  
3990  "But suppose, Harry, I became haggard, and old, and wrinkled?  What
3991  then?"
3992  
3993  "Ah, then," said Lord Henry, rising to go, "then, my dear Dorian, you
3994  would have to fight for your victories.  As it is, they are brought to
3995  you.  No, you must keep your good looks.  We live in an age that reads
3996  too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful.  We
3997  cannot spare you.  And now you had better dress and drive down to the
3998  club.  We are rather late, as it is."
3999  
4000  "I think I shall join you at the opera, Harry.  I feel too tired to eat
4001  anything.  What is the number of your sister's box?"
4002  
4003  "Twenty-seven, I believe.  It is on the grand tier.  You will see her
4004  name on the door.  But I am sorry you won't come and dine."
4005  
4006  "I don't feel up to it," said Dorian listlessly.  "But I am awfully
4007  obliged to you for all that you have said to me.  You are certainly my
4008  best friend.  No one has ever understood me as you have."
4009  
4010  "We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian," answered Lord
4011  Henry, shaking him by the hand.  "Good-bye. I shall see you before
4012  nine-thirty, I hope.  Remember, Patti is singing."
4013  
4014  As he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray touched the bell, and in
4015  a few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down.
4016  He waited impatiently for him to go.  The man seemed to take an
4017  interminable time over everything.
4018  
4019  As soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen and drew it back.  No;
4020  there was no further change in the picture.  It had received the news
4021  of Sibyl Vane's death before he had known of it himself.  It was
4022  conscious of the events of life as they occurred.  The vicious cruelty
4023  that marred the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt, appeared at the
4024  very moment that the girl had drunk the poison, whatever it was.  Or
4025  was it indifferent to results?  Did it merely take cognizance of what
4026  passed within the soul?  He wondered, and hoped that some day he would
4027  see the change taking place before his very eyes, shuddering as he
4028  hoped it.
4029  
4030  Poor Sibyl!  What a romance it had all been!  She had often mimicked
4031  death on the stage.  Then Death himself had touched her and taken her
4032  with him.  How had she played that dreadful last scene?  Had she cursed
4033  him, as she died?  No; she had died for love of him, and love would
4034  always be a sacrament to him now.  She had atoned for everything by the
4035  sacrifice she had made of her life.  He would not think any more of
4036  what she had made him go through, on that horrible night at the
4037  theatre.  When he thought of her, it would be as a wonderful tragic
4038  figure sent on to the world's stage to show the supreme reality of
4039  love.  A wonderful tragic figure?  Tears came to his eyes as he
4040  remembered her childlike look, and winsome fanciful ways, and shy
4041  tremulous grace.  He brushed them away hastily and looked again at the
4042  picture.
4043  
4044  He felt that the time had really come for making his choice.  Or had
4045  his choice already been made?  Yes, life had decided that for
4046  him--life, and his own infinite curiosity about life.  Eternal youth,
4047  infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder
4048  sins--he was to have all these things.  The portrait was to bear the
4049  burden of his shame: that was all.
4050  
4051  A feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration that
4052  was in store for the fair face on the canvas.  Once, in boyish mockery
4053  of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips
4054  that now smiled so cruelly at him.  Morning after morning he had sat
4055  before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as
4056  it seemed to him at times.  Was it to alter now with every mood to
4057  which he yielded?  Was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing, to
4058  be hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that
4059  had so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair?
4060  The pity of it! the pity of it!
4061  
4062  For a moment, he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that
4063  existed between him and the picture might cease.  It had changed in
4064  answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain
4065  unchanged.  And yet, who, that knew anything about life, would
4066  surrender the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that
4067  chance might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught?
4068  Besides, was it really under his control?  Had it indeed been prayer
4069  that had produced the substitution?  Might there not be some curious
4070  scientific reason for it all?  If thought could exercise its influence
4071  upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon
4072  dead and inorganic things?  Nay, without thought or conscious desire,
4073  might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods
4074  and passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity?
4075  But the reason was of no importance.  He would never again tempt by a
4076  prayer any terrible power.  If the picture was to alter, it was to
4077  alter.  That was all.  Why inquire too closely into it?
4078  
4079  For there would be a real pleasure in watching it.  He would be able to
4080  follow his mind into its secret places.  This portrait would be to him
4081  the most magical of mirrors.  As it had revealed to him his own body,
4082  so it would reveal to him his own soul.  And when winter came upon it,
4083  he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of
4084  summer.  When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid
4085  mask of chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood.
4086  Not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade.  Not one pulse of
4087  his life would ever weaken.  Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be
4088  strong, and fleet, and joyous.  What did it matter what happened to the
4089  coloured image on the canvas?  He would be safe.  That was everything.
4090  
4091  He drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture,
4092  smiling as he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where his valet was
4093  already waiting for him.  An hour later he was at the opera, and Lord
4094  Henry was leaning over his chair.
4095  
4096  
4097  
4098  CHAPTER 9
4099  
4100  As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown
4101  into the room.
4102  
4103  "I am so glad I have found you, Dorian," he said gravely.  "I called
4104  last night, and they told me you were at the opera.  Of course, I knew
4105  that was impossible.  But I wish you had left word where you had really
4106  gone to.  I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy
4107  might be followed by another.  I think you might have telegraphed for
4108  me when you heard of it first.  I read of it quite by chance in a late
4109  edition of _The Globe_ that I picked up at the club.  I came here at once
4110  and was miserable at not finding you.  I can't tell you how
4111  heart-broken I am about the whole thing.  I know what you must suffer.
4112  But where were you?  Did you go down and see the girl's mother?  For a
4113  moment I thought of following you there.  They gave the address in the
4114  paper.  Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn't it?  But I was afraid of
4115  intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten.  Poor woman!  What a
4116  state she must be in!  And her only child, too!  What did she say about
4117  it all?"
4118  
4119  "My dear Basil, how do I know?" murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some
4120  pale-yellow wine from a delicate, gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass
4121  and looking dreadfully bored.  "I was at the opera.  You should have
4122  come on there.  I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry's sister, for the first
4123  time.  We were in her box.  She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang
4124  divinely.  Don't talk about horrid subjects.  If one doesn't talk about
4125  a thing, it has never happened.  It is simply expression, as Harry
4126  says, that gives reality to things.  I may mention that she was not the
4127  woman's only child.  There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe.  But
4128  he is not on the stage.  He is a sailor, or something.  And now, tell
4129  me about yourself and what you are painting."
4130  
4131  "You went to the opera?" said Hallward, speaking very slowly and with a
4132  strained touch of pain in his voice.  "You went to the opera while
4133  Sibyl Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging?  You can talk to me
4134  of other women being charming, and of Patti singing divinely, before
4135  the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in?  Why,
4136  man, there are horrors in store for that little white body of hers!"
4137  
4138  "Stop, Basil!  I won't hear it!" cried Dorian, leaping to his feet.
4139  "You must not tell me about things.  What is done is done.  What is
4140  past is past."
4141  
4142  "You call yesterday the past?"
4143  
4144  "What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it?  It is only
4145  shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion.  A man who
4146  is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a
4147  pleasure.  I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions.  I want to
4148  use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them."
4149  
4150  "Dorian, this is horrible!  Something has changed you completely.  You
4151  look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come
4152  down to my studio to sit for his picture.  But you were simple,
4153  natural, and affectionate then.  You were the most unspoiled creature
4154  in the whole world.  Now, I don't know what has come over you.  You
4155  talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.  It is all Harry's
4156  influence.  I see that."
4157  
4158  The lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a few
4159  moments on the green, flickering, sun-lashed garden.  "I owe a great
4160  deal to Harry, Basil," he said at last, "more than I owe to you.  You
4161  only taught me to be vain."
4162  
4163  "Well, I am punished for that, Dorian--or shall be some day."
4164  
4165  "I don't know what you mean, Basil," he exclaimed, turning round.  "I
4166  don't know what you want.  What do you want?"
4167  
4168  "I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint," said the artist sadly.
4169  
4170  "Basil," said the lad, going over to him and putting his hand on his
4171  shoulder, "you have come too late.  Yesterday, when I heard that Sibyl
4172  Vane had killed herself--"
4173  
4174  "Killed herself!  Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?" cried
4175  Hallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror.
4176  
4177  "My dear Basil!  Surely you don't think it was a vulgar accident?  Of
4178  course she killed herself."
4179  
4180  The elder man buried his face in his hands.  "How fearful," he
4181  muttered, and a shudder ran through him.
4182  
4183  "No," said Dorian Gray, "there is nothing fearful about it.  It is one
4184  of the great romantic tragedies of the age.  As a rule, people who act
4185  lead the most commonplace lives.  They are good husbands, or faithful
4186  wives, or something tedious.  You know what I mean--middle-class virtue
4187  and all that kind of thing.  How different Sibyl was!  She lived her
4188  finest tragedy.  She was always a heroine.  The last night she
4189  played--the night you saw her--she acted badly because she had known
4190  the reality of love.  When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet
4191  might have died.  She passed again into the sphere of art.  There is
4192  something of the martyr about her.  Her death has all the pathetic
4193  uselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted beauty.  But, as I was saying,
4194  you must not think I have not suffered.  If you had come in yesterday
4195  at a particular moment--about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to
4196  six--you would have found me in tears.  Even Harry, who was here, who
4197  brought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through.  I
4198  suffered immensely.  Then it passed away.  I cannot repeat an emotion.
4199  No one can, except sentimentalists.  And you are awfully unjust, Basil.
4200  You come down here to console me.  That is charming of you.  You find
4201  me consoled, and you are furious.  How like a sympathetic person!  You
4202  remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who
4203  spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance
4204  redressed, or some unjust law altered--I forget exactly what it was.
4205  Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment.  He
4206  had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of _ennui_, and became a
4207  confirmed misanthrope.  And besides, my dear old Basil, if you really
4208  want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened, or to
4209  see it from a proper artistic point of view.  Was it not Gautier who
4210  used to write about _la consolation des arts_?  I remember picking up a
4211  little vellum-covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that
4212  delightful phrase.  Well, I am not like that young man you told me of
4213  when we were down at Marlow together, the young man who used to say
4214  that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life.  I
4215  love beautiful things that one can touch and handle.  Old brocades,
4216  green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings,
4217  luxury, pomp--there is much to be got from all these.  But the artistic
4218  temperament that they create, or at any rate reveal, is still more to
4219  me.  To become the spectator of one's own life, as Harry says, is to
4220  escape the suffering of life.  I know you are surprised at my talking
4221  to you like this.  You have not realized how I have developed.  I was a
4222  schoolboy when you knew me.  I am a man now.  I have new passions, new
4223  thoughts, new ideas.  I am different, but you must not like me less.  I
4224  am changed, but you must always be my friend.  Of course, I am very
4225  fond of Harry.  But I know that you are better than he is.  You are not
4226  stronger--you are too much afraid of life--but you are better.  And how
4227  happy we used to be together!  Don't leave me, Basil, and don't quarrel
4228  with me.  I am what I am.  There is nothing more to be said."
4229  
4230  The painter felt strangely moved.  The lad was infinitely dear to him,
4231  and his personality had been the great turning point in his art.  He
4232  could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more.  After all, his
4233  indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away.  There
4234  was so much in him that was good, so much in him that was noble.
4235  
4236  "Well, Dorian," he said at length, with a sad smile, "I won't speak to
4237  you again about this horrible thing, after to-day.  I only trust your
4238  name won't be mentioned in connection with it.  The inquest is to take
4239  place this afternoon.  Have they summoned you?"
4240  
4241  Dorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his face at
4242  the mention of the word "inquest."  There was something so crude and
4243  vulgar about everything of the kind.  "They don't know my name," he
4244  answered.
4245  
4246  "But surely she did?"
4247  
4248  "Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never mentioned
4249  to any one.  She told me once that they were all rather curious to
4250  learn who I was, and that she invariably told them my name was Prince
4251  Charming.  It was pretty of her.  You must do me a drawing of Sibyl,
4252  Basil.  I should like to have something more of her than the memory of
4253  a few kisses and some broken pathetic words."
4254  
4255  "I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you.  But you
4256  must come and sit to me yourself again.  I can't get on without you."
4257  
4258  "I can never sit to you again, Basil.  It is impossible!" he exclaimed,
4259  starting back.
4260  
4261  The painter stared at him.  "My dear boy, what nonsense!" he cried.
4262  "Do you mean to say you don't like what I did of you?  Where is it?
4263  Why have you pulled the screen in front of it?  Let me look at it.  It
4264  is the best thing I have ever done.  Do take the screen away, Dorian.
4265  It is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that.  I
4266  felt the room looked different as I came in."
4267  
4268  "My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil.  You don't imagine I let
4269  him arrange my room for me?  He settles my flowers for me
4270  sometimes--that is all.  No; I did it myself.  The light was too strong
4271  on the portrait."
4272  
4273  "Too strong!  Surely not, my dear fellow?  It is an admirable place for
4274  it.  Let me see it."  And Hallward walked towards the corner of the
4275  room.
4276  
4277  A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray's lips, and he rushed between
4278  the painter and the screen.  "Basil," he said, looking very pale, "you
4279  must not look at it.  I don't wish you to."
4280  
4281  "Not look at my own work!  You are not serious.  Why shouldn't I look
4282  at it?" exclaimed Hallward, laughing.
4283  
4284  "If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will never
4285  speak to you again as long as I live.  I am quite serious.  I don't
4286  offer any explanation, and you are not to ask for any.  But, remember,
4287  if you touch this screen, everything is over between us."
4288  
4289  Hallward was thunderstruck.  He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute
4290  amazement.  He had never seen him like this before.  The lad was
4291  actually pallid with rage.  His hands were clenched, and the pupils of
4292  his eyes were like disks of blue fire.  He was trembling all over.
4293  
4294  "Dorian!"
4295  
4296  "Don't speak!"
4297  
4298  "But what is the matter?  Of course I won't look at it if you don't
4299  want me to," he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and going over
4300  towards the window.  "But, really, it seems rather absurd that I
4301  shouldn't see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in
4302  Paris in the autumn.  I shall probably have to give it another coat of
4303  varnish before that, so I must see it some day, and why not to-day?"
4304  
4305  "To exhibit it!  You want to exhibit it?" exclaimed Dorian Gray, a
4306  strange sense of terror creeping over him.  Was the world going to be
4307  shown his secret?  Were people to gape at the mystery of his life?
4308  That was impossible.  Something--he did not know what--had to be done
4309  at once.
4310  
4311  "Yes; I don't suppose you will object to that.  Georges Petit is going
4312  to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de
4313  Seze, which will open the first week in October.  The portrait will
4314  only be away a month.  I should think you could easily spare it for
4315  that time.  In fact, you are sure to be out of town.  And if you keep
4316  it always behind a screen, you can't care much about it."
4317  
4318  Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead.  There were beads of
4319  perspiration there.  He felt that he was on the brink of a horrible
4320  danger.  "You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it," he
4321  cried.  "Why have you changed your mind?  You people who go in for
4322  being consistent have just as many moods as others have.  The only
4323  difference is that your moods are rather meaningless.  You can't have
4324  forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world
4325  would induce you to send it to any exhibition.  You told Harry exactly
4326  the same thing." He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light came into
4327  his eyes.  He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him once, half
4328  seriously and half in jest, "If you want to have a strange quarter of
4329  an hour, get Basil to tell you why he won't exhibit your picture.  He
4330  told me why he wouldn't, and it was a revelation to me."  Yes, perhaps
4331  Basil, too, had his secret.  He would ask him and try.
4332  
4333  "Basil," he said, coming over quite close and looking him straight in
4334  the face, "we have each of us a secret.  Let me know yours, and I shall
4335  tell you mine.  What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my
4336  picture?"
4337  
4338  The painter shuddered in spite of himself.  "Dorian, if I told you, you
4339  might like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me.  I
4340  could not bear your doing either of those two things.  If you wish me
4341  never to look at your picture again, I am content.  I have always you
4342  to look at.  If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden
4343  from the world, I am satisfied.  Your friendship is dearer to me than
4344  any fame or reputation."
4345  
4346  "No, Basil, you must tell me," insisted Dorian Gray.  "I think I have a
4347  right to know."  His feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity
4348  had taken its place.  He was determined to find out Basil Hallward's
4349  mystery.
4350  
4351  "Let us sit down, Dorian," said the painter, looking troubled.  "Let us
4352  sit down.  And just answer me one question.  Have you noticed in the
4353  picture something curious?--something that probably at first did not
4354  strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?"
4355  
4356  "Basil!" cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with trembling
4357  hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes.
4358  
4359  "I see you did.  Don't speak.  Wait till you hear what I have to say.
4360  Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most
4361  extraordinary influence over me.  I was dominated, soul, brain, and
4362  power, by you.  You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen
4363  ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream.  I
4364  worshipped you.  I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke.  I
4365  wanted to have you all to myself.  I was only happy when I was with
4366  you.  When you were away from me, you were still present in my art....
4367  Of course, I never let you know anything about this.  It would have
4368  been impossible.  You would not have understood it.  I hardly
4369  understood it myself.  I only knew that I had seen perfection face to
4370  face, and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes--too
4371  wonderful, perhaps, for in such mad worships there is peril, the peril
4372  of losing them, no less than the peril of keeping them....  Weeks and
4373  weeks went on, and I grew more and more absorbed in you.  Then came a
4374  new development.  I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour, and as
4375  Adonis with huntsman's cloak and polished boar-spear. Crowned with
4376  heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on the prow of Adrian's barge, gazing
4377  across the green turbid Nile.  You had leaned over the still pool of
4378  some Greek woodland and seen in the water's silent silver the marvel of
4379  your own face.  And it had all been what art should be--unconscious,
4380  ideal, and remote.  One day, a fatal day I sometimes think, I
4381  determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are,
4382  not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own dress and in your own
4383  time.  Whether it was the realism of the method, or the mere wonder of
4384  your own personality, thus directly presented to me without mist or
4385  veil, I cannot tell.  But I know that as I worked at it, every flake
4386  and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret.  I grew afraid
4387  that others would know of my idolatry.  I felt, Dorian, that I had told
4388  too much, that I had put too much of myself into it.  Then it was that
4389  I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited.  You were a
4390  little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me.
4391  Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me.  But I did not mind
4392  that.  When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I felt
4393  that I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing left my studio,
4394  and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its
4395  presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that I
4396  had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely good-looking
4397  and that I could paint.  Even now I cannot help feeling that it is a
4398  mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really
4399  shown in the work one creates.  Art is always more abstract than we
4400  fancy.  Form and colour tell us of form and colour--that is all.  It
4401  often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than
4402  it ever reveals him.  And so when I got this offer from Paris, I
4403  determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.
4404  It never occurred to me that you would refuse.  I see now that you were
4405  right.  The picture cannot be shown.  You must not be angry with me,
4406  Dorian, for what I have told you.  As I said to Harry, once, you are
4407  made to be worshipped."
4408  
4409  Dorian Gray drew a long breath.  The colour came back to his cheeks,
4410  and a smile played about his lips.  The peril was over.  He was safe
4411  for the time.  Yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the
4412  painter who had just made this strange confession to him, and wondered
4413  if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a
4414  friend.  Lord Henry had the charm of being very dangerous.  But that
4415  was all.  He was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of.
4416  Would there ever be some one who would fill him with a strange
4417  idolatry?  Was that one of the things that life had in store?
4418  
4419  "It is extraordinary to me, Dorian," said Hallward, "that you should
4420  have seen this in the portrait.  Did you really see it?"
4421  
4422  "I saw something in it," he answered, "something that seemed to me very
4423  curious."
4424  
4425  "Well, you don't mind my looking at the thing now?"
4426  
4427  Dorian shook his head.  "You must not ask me that, Basil.  I could not
4428  possibly let you stand in front of that picture."
4429  
4430  "You will some day, surely?"
4431  
4432  "Never."
4433  
4434  "Well, perhaps you are right.  And now good-bye, Dorian.  You have been
4435  the one person in my life who has really influenced my art.  Whatever I
4436  have done that is good, I owe to you.  Ah! you don't know what it cost
4437  me to tell you all that I have told you."
4438  
4439  "My dear Basil," said Dorian, "what have you told me?  Simply that you
4440  felt that you admired me too much.  That is not even a compliment."
4441  
4442  "It was not intended as a compliment.  It was a confession.  Now that I
4443  have made it, something seems to have gone out of me.  Perhaps one
4444  should never put one's worship into words."
4445  
4446  "It was a very disappointing confession."
4447  
4448  "Why, what did you expect, Dorian?  You didn't see anything else in the
4449  picture, did you?  There was nothing else to see?"
4450  
4451  "No; there was nothing else to see.  Why do you ask?  But you mustn't
4452  talk about worship.  It is foolish.  You and I are friends, Basil, and
4453  we must always remain so."
4454  
4455  "You have got Harry," said the painter sadly.
4456  
4457  "Oh, Harry!" cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter.  "Harry spends
4458  his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is
4459  improbable.  Just the sort of life I would like to lead.  But still I
4460  don't think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble.  I would sooner
4461  go to you, Basil."
4462  
4463  "You will sit to me again?"
4464  
4465  "Impossible!"
4466  
4467  "You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian.  No man comes
4468  across two ideal things.  Few come across one."
4469  
4470  "I can't explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again.
4471  There is something fatal about a portrait.  It has a life of its own.
4472  I will come and have tea with you.  That will be just as pleasant."
4473  
4474  "Pleasanter for you, I am afraid," murmured Hallward regretfully.  "And
4475  now good-bye. I am sorry you won't let me look at the picture once
4476  again.  But that can't be helped.  I quite understand what you feel
4477  about it."
4478  
4479  As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself.  Poor Basil!  How
4480  little he knew of the true reason!  And how strange it was that,
4481  instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had
4482  succeeded, almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend!  How
4483  much that strange confession explained to him!  The painter's absurd
4484  fits of jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant panegyrics, his
4485  curious reticences--he understood them all now, and he felt sorry.
4486  There seemed to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured
4487  by romance.
4488  
4489  He sighed and touched the bell.  The portrait must be hidden away at
4490  all costs.  He could not run such a risk of discovery again.  It had
4491  been mad of him to have allowed the thing to remain, even for an hour,
4492  in a room to which any of his friends had access.
4493  
4494  
4495  
4496  CHAPTER 10
4497  
4498  When his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if
4499  he had thought of peering behind the screen.  The man was quite
4500  impassive and waited for his orders.  Dorian lit a cigarette and walked
4501  over to the glass and glanced into it.  He could see the reflection of
4502  Victor's face perfectly.  It was like a placid mask of servility.
4503  There was nothing to be afraid of, there.  Yet he thought it best to be
4504  on his guard.
4505  
4506  Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the house-keeper that he
4507  wanted to see her, and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him to
4508  send two of his men round at once.  It seemed to him that as the man
4509  left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen.  Or was
4510  that merely his own fancy?
4511  
4512  After a few moments, in her black silk dress, with old-fashioned thread
4513  mittens on her wrinkled hands, Mrs. Leaf bustled into the library.  He
4514  asked her for the key of the schoolroom.
4515  
4516  "The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?" she exclaimed.  "Why, it is full of
4517  dust.  I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it.
4518  It is not fit for you to see, sir.  It is not, indeed."
4519  
4520  "I don't want it put straight, Leaf.  I only want the key."
4521  
4522  "Well, sir, you'll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it.  Why, it
4523  hasn't been opened for nearly five years--not since his lordship died."
4524  
4525  He winced at the mention of his grandfather.  He had hateful memories
4526  of him.  "That does not matter," he answered.  "I simply want to see
4527  the place--that is all.  Give me the key."
4528  
4529  "And here is the key, sir," said the old lady, going over the contents
4530  of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands.  "Here is the key.  I'll
4531  have it off the bunch in a moment.  But you don't think of living up
4532  there, sir, and you so comfortable here?"
4533  
4534  "No, no," he cried petulantly.  "Thank you, Leaf.  That will do."
4535  
4536  She lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of
4537  the household.  He sighed and told her to manage things as she thought
4538  best.  She left the room, wreathed in smiles.
4539  
4540  As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked round
4541  the room.  His eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily
4542  embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century
4543  Venetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna.
4544  Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in.  It had perhaps
4545  served often as a pall for the dead.  Now it was to hide something that
4546  had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of death
4547  itself--something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.
4548  What the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image
4549  on the canvas.  They would mar its beauty and eat away its grace.  They
4550  would defile it and make it shameful.  And yet the thing would still
4551  live on.  It would be always alive.
4552  
4553  He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told Basil
4554  the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away.  Basil
4555  would have helped him to resist Lord Henry's influence, and the still
4556  more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament.  The love
4557  that he bore him--for it was really love--had nothing in it that was
4558  not noble and intellectual.  It was not that mere physical admiration
4559  of beauty that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses
4560  tire.  It was such love as Michelangelo had known, and Montaigne, and
4561  Winckelmann, and Shakespeare himself.  Yes, Basil could have saved him.
4562  But it was too late now.  The past could always be annihilated.
4563  Regret, denial, or forgetfulness could do that.  But the future was
4564  inevitable.  There were passions in him that would find their terrible
4565  outlet, dreams that would make the shadow of their evil real.
4566  
4567  He took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that
4568  covered it, and, holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen.
4569  Was the face on the canvas viler than before?  It seemed to him that it
4570  was unchanged, and yet his loathing of it was intensified.  Gold hair,
4571  blue eyes, and rose-red lips--they all were there.  It was simply the
4572  expression that had altered.  That was horrible in its cruelty.
4573  Compared to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke, how shallow Basil's
4574  reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!--how shallow, and of what little
4575  account!  His own soul was looking out at him from the canvas and
4576  calling him to judgement.  A look of pain came across him, and he flung
4577  the rich pall over the picture.  As he did so, a knock came to the
4578  door.  He passed out as his servant entered.
4579  
4580  "The persons are here, Monsieur."
4581  
4582  He felt that the man must be got rid of at once.  He must not be
4583  allowed to know where the picture was being taken to.  There was
4584  something sly about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes.
4585  Sitting down at the writing-table he scribbled a note to Lord Henry,
4586  asking him to send him round something to read and reminding him that
4587  they were to meet at eight-fifteen that evening.
4588  
4589  "Wait for an answer," he said, handing it to him, "and show the men in
4590  here."
4591  
4592  In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard
4593  himself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in
4594  with a somewhat rough-looking young assistant.  Mr. Hubbard was a
4595  florid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was
4596  considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the
4597  artists who dealt with him.  As a rule, he never left his shop.  He
4598  waited for people to come to him.  But he always made an exception in
4599  favour of Dorian Gray.  There was something about Dorian that charmed
4600  everybody.  It was a pleasure even to see him.
4601  
4602  "What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?" he said, rubbing his fat freckled
4603  hands.  "I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in
4604  person.  I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir.  Picked it up at a
4605  sale.  Old Florentine.  Came from Fonthill, I believe.  Admirably
4606  suited for a religious subject, Mr. Gray."
4607  
4608  "I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round, Mr.
4609  Hubbard.  I shall certainly drop in and look at the frame--though I
4610  don't go in much at present for religious art--but to-day I only want a
4611  picture carried to the top of the house for me.  It is rather heavy, so
4612  I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men."
4613  
4614  "No trouble at all, Mr. Gray.  I am delighted to be of any service to
4615  you.  Which is the work of art, sir?"
4616  
4617  "This," replied Dorian, moving the screen back.  "Can you move it,
4618  covering and all, just as it is?  I don't want it to get scratched
4619  going upstairs."
4620  
4621  "There will be no difficulty, sir," said the genial frame-maker,
4622  beginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture from
4623  the long brass chains by which it was suspended.  "And, now, where
4624  shall we carry it to, Mr. Gray?"
4625  
4626  "I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow me.
4627  Or perhaps you had better go in front.  I am afraid it is right at the
4628  top of the house.  We will go up by the front staircase, as it is
4629  wider."
4630  
4631  He held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and
4632  began the ascent.  The elaborate character of the frame had made the
4633  picture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the obsequious
4634  protests of Mr. Hubbard, who had the true tradesman's spirited dislike
4635  of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian put his hand to it
4636  so as to help them.
4637  
4638  "Something of a load to carry, sir," gasped the little man when they
4639  reached the top landing.  And he wiped his shiny forehead.
4640  
4641  "I am afraid it is rather heavy," murmured Dorian as he unlocked the
4642  door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious
4643  secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men.
4644  
4645  He had not entered the place for more than four years--not, indeed,
4646  since he had used it first as a play-room when he was a child, and then
4647  as a study when he grew somewhat older.  It was a large,
4648  well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord
4649  Kelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for his strange likeness
4650  to his mother, and also for other reasons, he had always hated and
4651  desired to keep at a distance.  It appeared to Dorian to have but
4652  little changed.  There was the huge Italian _cassone_, with its
4653  fantastically painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which
4654  he had so often hidden himself as a boy.  There the satinwood book-case
4655  filled with his dog-eared schoolbooks.  On the wall behind it was
4656  hanging the same ragged Flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen
4657  were playing chess in a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by,
4658  carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted wrists.  How well he
4659  remembered it all!  Every moment of his lonely childhood came back to
4660  him as he looked round.  He recalled the stainless purity of his boyish
4661  life, and it seemed horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait
4662  was to be hidden away.  How little he had thought, in those dead days,
4663  of all that was in store for him!
4664  
4665  But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as
4666  this.  He had the key, and no one else could enter it.  Beneath its
4667  purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden,
4668  and unclean.  What did it matter?  No one could see it.  He himself
4669  would not see it.  Why should he watch the hideous corruption of his
4670  soul?  He kept his youth--that was enough.  And, besides, might not
4671  his nature grow finer, after all?  There was no reason that the future
4672  should be so full of shame.  Some love might come across his life, and
4673  purify him, and shield him from those sins that seemed to be already
4674  stirring in spirit and in flesh--those curious unpictured sins whose
4675  very mystery lent them their subtlety and their charm.  Perhaps, some
4676  day, the cruel look would have passed away from the scarlet sensitive
4677  mouth, and he might show to the world Basil Hallward's masterpiece.
4678  
4679  No; that was impossible.  Hour by hour, and week by week, the thing
4680  upon the canvas was growing old.  It might escape the hideousness of
4681  sin, but the hideousness of age was in store for it.  The cheeks would
4682  become hollow or flaccid.  Yellow crow's feet would creep round the
4683  fading eyes and make them horrible.  The hair would lose its
4684  brightness, the mouth would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross,
4685  as the mouths of old men are.  There would be the wrinkled throat, the
4686  cold, blue-veined hands, the twisted body, that he remembered in the
4687  grandfather who had been so stern to him in his boyhood.  The picture
4688  had to be concealed.  There was no help for it.
4689  
4690  "Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please," he said, wearily, turning round.
4691  "I am sorry I kept you so long.  I was thinking of something else."
4692  
4693  "Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray," answered the frame-maker, who
4694  was still gasping for breath.  "Where shall we put it, sir?"
4695  
4696  "Oh, anywhere.  Here:  this will do.  I don't want to have it hung up.
4697  Just lean it against the wall.  Thanks."
4698  
4699  "Might one look at the work of art, sir?"
4700  
4701  Dorian started.  "It would not interest you, Mr. Hubbard," he said,
4702  keeping his eye on the man.  He felt ready to leap upon him and fling
4703  him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that
4704  concealed the secret of his life.  "I shan't trouble you any more now.
4705  I am much obliged for your kindness in coming round."
4706  
4707  "Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray.  Ever ready to do anything for you,
4708  sir." And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the assistant,
4709  who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough
4710  uncomely face.  He had never seen any one so marvellous.
4711  
4712  When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked the door
4713  and put the key in his pocket.  He felt safe now.  No one would ever
4714  look upon the horrible thing.  No eye but his would ever see his shame.
4715  
4716  On reaching the library, he found that it was just after five o'clock
4717  and that the tea had been already brought up.  On a little table of
4718  dark perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady
4719  Radley, his guardian's wife, a pretty professional invalid who had
4720  spent the preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry,
4721  and beside it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn
4722  and the edges soiled.  A copy of the third edition of _The St. James's
4723  Gazette_ had been placed on the tea-tray. It was evident that Victor had
4724  returned.  He wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were
4725  leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing.
4726  He would be sure to miss the picture--had no doubt missed it already,
4727  while he had been laying the tea-things. The screen had not been set
4728  back, and a blank space was visible on the wall.  Perhaps some night he
4729  might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the
4730  room.  It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one's house.  He had
4731  heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some
4732  servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked
4733  up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower
4734  or a shred of crumpled lace.
4735  
4736  He sighed, and having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord Henry's
4737  note.  It was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper,
4738  and a book that might interest him, and that he would be at the club at
4739  eight-fifteen. He opened _The St. James's_ languidly, and looked through
4740  it.  A red pencil-mark on the fifth page caught his eye.  It drew
4741  attention to the following paragraph:
4742  
4743  
4744  INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.--An inquest was held this morning at the Bell
4745  Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body of
4746  Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre,
4747  Holborn.  A verdict of death by misadventure was returned.
4748  Considerable sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased, who
4749  was greatly affected during the giving of her own evidence, and that of
4750  Dr. Birrell, who had made the post-mortem examination of the deceased.
4751  
4752  
4753  He frowned, and tearing the paper in two, went across the room and
4754  flung the pieces away.  How ugly it all was!  And how horribly real
4755  ugliness made things!  He felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry for
4756  having sent him the report.  And it was certainly stupid of him to have
4757  marked it with red pencil.  Victor might have read it.  The man knew
4758  more than enough English for that.
4759  
4760  Perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something.  And, yet,
4761  what did it matter?  What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane's
4762  death?  There was nothing to fear.  Dorian Gray had not killed her.
4763  
4764  His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him.  What was
4765  it, he wondered.  He went towards the little, pearl-coloured octagonal
4766  stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange
4767  Egyptian bees that wrought in silver, and taking up the volume, flung
4768  himself into an arm-chair and began to turn over the leaves.  After a
4769  few minutes he became absorbed.  It was the strangest book that he had
4770  ever read.  It seemed to him that in exquisite raiment, and to the
4771  delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were passing in dumb
4772  show before him.  Things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly
4773  made real to him.  Things of which he had never dreamed were gradually
4774  revealed.
4775  
4776  It was a novel without a plot and with only one character, being,
4777  indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who
4778  spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the
4779  passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his
4780  own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods through
4781  which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere
4782  artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue,
4783  as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin.  The
4784  style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vivid
4785  and obscure at once, full of _argot_ and of archaisms, of technical
4786  expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work
4787  of some of the finest artists of the French school of _Symbolistes_.
4788  There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in
4789  colour.  The life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical
4790  philosophy.  One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the
4791  spiritual ecstasies of some mediaeval saint or the morbid confessions
4792  of a modern sinner.  It was a poisonous book.  The heavy odour of
4793  incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain.  The
4794  mere cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so
4795  full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated,
4796  produced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter,
4797  a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of
4798  the falling day and creeping shadows.
4799  
4800  Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky gleamed
4801  through the windows.  He read on by its wan light till he could read no
4802  more.  Then, after his valet had reminded him several times of the
4803  lateness of the hour, he got up, and going into the next room, placed
4804  the book on the little Florentine table that always stood at his
4805  bedside and began to dress for dinner.
4806  
4807  It was almost nine o'clock before he reached the club, where he found
4808  Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very much bored.
4809  
4810  "I am so sorry, Harry," he cried, "but really it is entirely your
4811  fault.  That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the
4812  time was going."
4813  
4814  "Yes, I thought you would like it," replied his host, rising from his
4815  chair.
4816  
4817  "I didn't say I liked it, Harry.  I said it fascinated me.  There is a
4818  great difference."
4819  
4820  "Ah, you have discovered that?" murmured Lord Henry.  And they passed
4821  into the dining-room.
4822  
4823  
4824  
4825  CHAPTER 11
4826  
4827  For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of
4828  this book.  Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never
4829  sought to free himself from it.  He procured from Paris no less than
4830  nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in
4831  different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the
4832  changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have
4833  almost entirely lost control.  The hero, the wonderful young Parisian
4834  in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely
4835  blended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself.  And,
4836  indeed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own
4837  life, written before he had lived it.
4838  
4839  In one point he was more fortunate than the novel's fantastic hero.  He
4840  never knew--never, indeed, had any cause to know--that somewhat
4841  grotesque dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still
4842  water which came upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was
4843  occasioned by the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently,
4844  been so remarkable.  It was with an almost cruel joy--and perhaps in
4845  nearly every joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its
4846  place--that he used to read the latter part of the book, with its
4847  really tragic, if somewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and
4848  despair of one who had himself lost what in others, and the world, he
4849  had most dearly valued.
4850  
4851  For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and
4852  many others besides him, seemed never to leave him.  Even those who had
4853  heard the most evil things against him--and from time to time strange
4854  rumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the
4855  chatter of the clubs--could not believe anything to his dishonour when
4856  they saw him.  He had always the look of one who had kept himself
4857  unspotted from the world.  Men who talked grossly became silent when
4858  Dorian Gray entered the room.  There was something in the purity of his
4859  face that rebuked them.  His mere presence seemed to recall to them the
4860  memory of the innocence that they had tarnished.  They wondered how one
4861  so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an
4862  age that was at once sordid and sensual.
4863  
4864  Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged
4865  absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were
4866  his friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep
4867  upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left
4868  him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil
4869  Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging face on
4870  the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him
4871  from the polished glass.  The very sharpness of the contrast used to
4872  quicken his sense of pleasure.  He grew more and more enamoured of his
4873  own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul.
4874  He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and
4875  terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead
4876  or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which
4877  were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age.  He would
4878  place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture,
4879  and smile.  He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.
4880  
4881  There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own
4882  delicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little
4883  ill-famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in
4884  disguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he
4885  had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant
4886  because it was purely selfish.  But moments such as these were rare.
4887  That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as
4888  they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase
4889  with gratification.  The more he knew, the more he desired to know.  He
4890  had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.
4891  
4892  Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to
4893  society.  Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each
4894  Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the
4895  world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the
4896  day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art.  His little
4897  dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were
4898  noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited,
4899  as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with
4900  its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered
4901  cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver.  Indeed, there were many,
4902  especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw,
4903  in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often
4904  dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of
4905  the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and
4906  perfect manner of a citizen of the world.  To them he seemed to be of
4907  the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to "make
4908  themselves perfect by the worship of beauty."  Like Gautier, he was one
4909  for whom "the visible world existed."
4910  
4911  And, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the
4912  arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation.
4913  Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment
4914  universal, and dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert
4915  the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for
4916  him.  His mode of dressing, and the particular styles that from time to
4917  time he affected, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of
4918  the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in
4919  everything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of
4920  his graceful, though to him only half-serious, fopperies.
4921  
4922  For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost
4923  immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a
4924  subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the
4925  London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the
4926  Satyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be
4927  something more than a mere _arbiter elegantiarum_, to be consulted on the
4928  wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of a
4929  cane.  He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have
4930  its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the
4931  spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.
4932  
4933  The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been
4934  decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and
4935  sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are
4936  conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence.
4937  But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had
4938  never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal
4939  merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or
4940  to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a
4941  new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the
4942  dominant characteristic.  As he looked back upon man moving through
4943  history, he was haunted by a feeling of loss.  So much had been
4944  surrendered! and to such little purpose!  There had been mad wilful
4945  rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose
4946  origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more
4947  terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance,
4948  they had sought to escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out
4949  the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to
4950  the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions.
4951  
4952  Yes:  there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism
4953  that was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely
4954  puritanism that is having, in our own day, its curious revival.  It was
4955  to have its service of the intellect, certainly, yet it was never to
4956  accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any
4957  mode of passionate experience.  Its aim, indeed, was to be experience
4958  itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might
4959  be.  Of the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar
4960  profligacy that dulls them, it was to know nothing.  But it was to
4961  teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is
4962  itself but a moment.
4963  
4964  There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either
4965  after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of
4966  death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through
4967  the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality
4968  itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques,
4969  and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one
4970  might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled
4971  with the malady of reverie.  Gradually white fingers creep through the
4972  curtains, and they appear to tremble.  In black fantastic shapes, dumb
4973  shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there.  Outside,
4974  there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men
4975  going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down
4976  from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it
4977  feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from
4978  her purple cave.  Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by
4979  degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we
4980  watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern.  The wan
4981  mirrors get back their mimic life.  The flameless tapers stand where we
4982  had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been
4983  studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the
4984  letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often.
4985  Nothing seems to us changed.  Out of the unreal shadows of the night
4986  comes back the real life that we had known.  We have to resume it where
4987  we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the
4988  necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of
4989  stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids
4990  might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in
4991  the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh
4992  shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in
4993  which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate,
4994  in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of
4995  joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.
4996  
4997  It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray
4998  to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his
4999  search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and
5000  possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he
5001  would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really
5002  alien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and
5003  then, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his
5004  intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that
5005  is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that,
5006  indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition
5007  of it.
5008  
5009  It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman
5010  Catholic communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great
5011  attraction for him.  The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all
5012  the sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by its superb
5013  rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity
5014  of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it
5015  sought to symbolize.  He loved to kneel down on the cold marble
5016  pavement and watch the priest, in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly
5017  and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or
5018  raising aloft the jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid
5019  wafer that at times, one would fain think, is indeed the "_panis
5020  caelestis_," the bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the
5021  Passion of Christ, breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his
5022  breast for his sins.  The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their
5023  lace and scarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their
5024  subtle fascination for him.  As he passed out, he used to look with
5025  wonder at the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of
5026  one of them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn
5027  grating the true story of their lives.
5028  
5029  But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual
5030  development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of
5031  mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable
5032  for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which
5033  there are no stars and the moon is in travail.  Mysticism, with its
5034  marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle
5035  antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a
5036  season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of
5037  the _Darwinismus_ movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in
5038  tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the
5039  brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of
5040  the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions,
5041  morbid or healthy, normal or diseased.  Yet, as has been said of him
5042  before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance
5043  compared with life itself.  He felt keenly conscious of how barren all
5044  intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment.
5045  He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual
5046  mysteries to reveal.
5047  
5048  And so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their
5049  manufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums
5050  from the East.  He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not
5051  its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their
5052  true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one
5053  mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one's passions, and in violets
5054  that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the
5055  brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often
5056  to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several
5057  influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers;
5058  of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that
5059  sickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to
5060  be able to expel melancholy from the soul.
5061  
5062  At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long
5063  latticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of
5064  olive-green lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad
5065  gipsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave, yellow-shawled
5066  Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while
5067  grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and, crouching
5068  upon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of
5069  reed or brass and charmed--or feigned to charm--great hooded snakes and
5070  horrible horned adders.  The harsh intervals and shrill discords of
5071  barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert's grace, and Chopin's
5072  beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell
5073  unheeded on his ear.  He collected together from all parts of the world
5074  the strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of
5075  dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact
5076  with Western civilizations, and loved to touch and try them.  He had
5077  the mysterious _juruparis_ of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not
5078  allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been
5079  subjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the
5080  Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human
5081  bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the sonorous green
5082  jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular
5083  sweetness.  He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when
5084  they were shaken; the long _clarin_ of the Mexicans, into which the
5085  performer does not blow, but through which he inhales the air; the
5086  harsh _ture_ of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who
5087  sit all day long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a
5088  distance of three leagues; the _teponaztli_, that has two vibrating
5089  tongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an
5090  elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants; the _yotl_-bells of
5091  the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge
5092  cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the
5093  one that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican
5094  temple, and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a
5095  description.  The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated
5096  him, and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art, like
5097  Nature, has her monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous
5098  voices.  Yet, after some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his
5099  box at the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt
5100  pleasure to "Tannhauser" and seeing in the prelude to that great work
5101  of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul.
5102  
5103  On one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a
5104  costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered
5105  with five hundred and sixty pearls.  This taste enthralled him for
5106  years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him.  He would often
5107  spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various
5108  stones that he had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that
5109  turns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver,
5110  the pistachio-coloured peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes,
5111  carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous, four-rayed stars, flame-red
5112  cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their
5113  alternate layers of ruby and sapphire.  He loved the red gold of the
5114  sunstone, and the moonstone's pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow
5115  of the milky opal.  He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of
5116  extraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise _de la
5117  vieille roche_ that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.
5118  
5119  He discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels.  In Alphonso's
5120  Clericalis Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real
5121  jacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of
5122  Emathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan snakes "with
5123  collars of real emeralds growing on their backs." There was a gem in
5124  the brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us, and "by the exhibition
5125  of golden letters and a scarlet robe" the monster could be thrown into
5126  a magical sleep and slain.  According to the great alchemist, Pierre de
5127  Boniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India
5128  made him eloquent.  The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth
5129  provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine.  The
5130  garnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her
5131  colour.  The selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus,
5132  that discovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids.
5133  Leonardus Camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a
5134  newly killed toad, that was a certain antidote against poison.  The
5135  bezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a charm
5136  that could cure the plague.  In the nests of Arabian birds was the
5137  aspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the wearer from any
5138  danger by fire.
5139  
5140  The King of Ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in his hand,
5141  as the ceremony of his coronation.  The gates of the palace of John the
5142  Priest were "made of sardius, with the horn of the horned snake
5143  inwrought, so that no man might bring poison within." Over the gable
5144  were "two golden apples, in which were two carbuncles," so that the
5145  gold might shine by day and the carbuncles by night.  In Lodge's
5146  strange romance 'A Margarite of America', it was stated that in the
5147  chamber of the queen one could behold "all the chaste ladies of the
5148  world, inchased out of silver, looking through fair mirrours of
5149  chrysolites, carbuncles, sapphires, and greene emeraults." Marco Polo
5150  had seen the inhabitants of Zipangu place rose-coloured pearls in the
5151  mouths of the dead.  A sea-monster had been enamoured of the pearl that
5152  the diver brought to King Perozes, and had slain the thief, and mourned
5153  for seven moons over its loss.  When the Huns lured the king into the
5154  great pit, he flung it away--Procopius tells the story--nor was it ever
5155  found again, though the Emperor Anastasius offered five hundred-weight
5156  of gold pieces for it.  The King of Malabar had shown to a certain
5157  Venetian a rosary of three hundred and four pearls, one for every god
5158  that he worshipped.
5159  
5160  When the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI, visited Louis XII of
5161  France, his horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to Brantome,
5162  and his cap had double rows of rubies that threw out a great light.
5163  Charles of England had ridden in stirrups hung with four hundred and
5164  twenty-one diamonds.  Richard II had a coat, valued at thirty thousand
5165  marks, which was covered with balas rubies.  Hall described Henry VIII,
5166  on his way to the Tower previous to his coronation, as wearing "a
5167  jacket of raised gold, the placard embroidered with diamonds and other
5168  rich stones, and a great bauderike about his neck of large balasses."
5169  The favourites of James I wore ear-rings of emeralds set in gold
5170  filigrane.  Edward II gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold armour
5171  studded with jacinths, a collar of gold roses set with
5172  turquoise-stones, and a skull-cap _parseme_ with pearls.  Henry II wore
5173  jewelled gloves reaching to the elbow, and had a hawk-glove sewn with
5174  twelve rubies and fifty-two great orients.  The ducal hat of Charles
5175  the Rash, the last Duke of Burgundy of his race, was hung with
5176  pear-shaped pearls and studded with sapphires.
5177  
5178  How exquisite life had once been!  How gorgeous in its pomp and
5179  decoration!  Even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful.
5180  
5181  Then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that
5182  performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern
5183  nations of Europe.  As he investigated the subject--and he always had
5184  an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment
5185  in whatever he took up--he was almost saddened by the reflection of the
5186  ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things.  He, at any
5187  rate, had escaped that.  Summer followed summer, and the yellow
5188  jonquils bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the
5189  story of their shame, but he was unchanged.  No winter marred his face
5190  or stained his flowerlike bloom.  How different it was with material
5191  things!  Where had they passed to?  Where was the great crocus-coloured
5192  robe, on which the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked
5193  by brown girls for the pleasure of Athena?  Where the huge velarium
5194  that Nero had stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail
5195  of purple on which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a
5196  chariot drawn by white, gilt-reined steeds?  He longed to see the
5197  curious table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were
5198  displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast;
5199  the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden
5200  bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of
5201  Pontus and were figured with "lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests,
5202  rocks, hunters--all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature"; and
5203  the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which
5204  were embroidered the verses of a song beginning "_Madame, je suis tout
5205  joyeux_," the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold
5206  thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four
5207  pearls.  He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims
5208  for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with "thirteen
5209  hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the
5210  king's arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings
5211  were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked
5212  in gold."  Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of
5213  black velvet powdered with crescents and suns.  Its curtains were of
5214  damask, with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver
5215  ground, and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it
5216  stood in a room hung with rows of the queen's devices in cut black
5217  velvet upon cloth of silver.  Louis XIV had gold embroidered caryatides
5218  fifteen feet high in his apartment.  The state bed of Sobieski, King of
5219  Poland, was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with
5220  verses from the Koran.  Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully
5221  chased, and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions.  It
5222  had been taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of
5223  Mohammed had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.
5224  
5225  And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite
5226  specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting
5227  the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and
5228  stitched over with iridescent beetles' wings; the Dacca gauzes, that
5229  from their transparency are known in the East as "woven air," and
5230  "running water," and "evening dew"; strange figured cloths from Java;
5231  elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair
5232  blue silks and wrought with _fleurs-de-lis_, birds and images; veils of
5233  _lacis_ worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish
5234  velvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese _Foukousas_,
5235  with their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds.
5236  
5237  He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed
5238  he had for everything connected with the service of the Church.  In the
5239  long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house, he had
5240  stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the
5241  raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and
5242  fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by
5243  the suffering that she seeks for and wounded by self-inflicted pain.
5244  He possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask,
5245  figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in
5246  six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the
5247  pine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls. The orphreys were divided
5248  into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the
5249  coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood.
5250  This was Italian work of the fifteenth century.  Another cope was of
5251  green velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves,
5252  from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which
5253  were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals.  The morse
5254  bore a seraph's head in gold-thread raised work.  The orphreys were
5255  woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with
5256  medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian.
5257  He had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold
5258  brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with
5259  representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and
5260  embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of
5261  white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins
5262  and _fleurs-de-lis_; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen; and
5263  many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria.  In the mystic offices to
5264  which such things were put, there was something that quickened his
5265  imagination.
5266  
5267  For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely
5268  house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he
5269  could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times
5270  to be almost too great to be borne.  Upon the walls of the lonely
5271  locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with
5272  his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him
5273  the real degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the
5274  purple-and-gold pall as a curtain.  For weeks he would not go there,
5275  would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart,
5276  his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence.
5277  Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to
5278  dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day,
5279  until he was driven away.  On his return he would sit in front of the
5280  picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other
5281  times, with that pride of individualism that is half the
5282  fascination of sin, and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen
5283  shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been his own.
5284  
5285  After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and
5286  gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as
5287  well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more
5288  than once spent the winter.  He hated to be separated from the picture
5289  that was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that during his
5290  absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the
5291  elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door.
5292  
5293  He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing.  It was true
5294  that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness
5295  of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn
5296  from that?  He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him.  He had
5297  not painted it.  What was it to him how vile and full of shame it
5298  looked?  Even if he told them, would they believe it?
5299  
5300  Yet he was afraid.  Sometimes when he was down at his great house in
5301  Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank
5302  who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton
5303  luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly
5304  leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not
5305  been tampered with and that the picture was still there.  What if it
5306  should be stolen?  The mere thought made him cold with horror.  Surely
5307  the world would know his secret then.  Perhaps the world already
5308  suspected it.
5309  
5310  For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him.
5311  He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth
5312  and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was
5313  said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the
5314  smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another
5315  gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out.  Curious stories
5316  became current about him after he had passed his twenty-fifth year.  It
5317  was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a
5318  low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with
5319  thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade.  His
5320  extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear
5321  again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass
5322  him with a sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as though
5323  they were determined to discover his secret.
5324  
5325  Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice,
5326  and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his
5327  charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth
5328  that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer
5329  to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about
5330  him.  It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most
5331  intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him.  Women who had
5332  wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and
5333  set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or
5334  horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.
5335  
5336  Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his
5337  strange and dangerous charm.  His great wealth was a certain element of
5338  security.  Society--civilized society, at least--is never very ready to
5339  believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and
5340  fascinating.  It feels instinctively that manners are of more
5341  importance than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability
5342  is of much less value than the possession of a good _chef_.  And, after
5343  all, it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has
5344  given one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private
5345  life.  Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold _entrees_, as
5346  Lord Henry remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is
5347  possibly a good deal to be said for his view.  For the canons of good
5348  society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art.  Form is
5349  absolutely essential to it.  It should have the dignity of a ceremony,
5350  as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of
5351  a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful
5352  to us.  Is insincerity such a terrible thing?  I think not.  It is
5353  merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.
5354  
5355  Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray's opinion.  He used to wonder at the
5356  shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing
5357  simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence.  To him, man was a
5358  being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform
5359  creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and
5360  passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies
5361  of the dead.  He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery
5362  of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose
5363  blood flowed in his veins.  Here was Philip Herbert, described by
5364  Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and
5365  King James, as one who was "caressed by the Court for his handsome
5366  face, which kept him not long company."  Was it young Herbert's life
5367  that he sometimes led?  Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body
5368  to body till it had reached his own?  Was it some dim sense of that
5369  ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause,
5370  give utterance, in Basil Hallward's studio, to the mad prayer that had
5371  so changed his life?  Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled
5372  surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard,
5373  with his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet.  What had this
5374  man's legacy been?  Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him
5375  some inheritance of sin and shame?  Were his own actions merely the
5376  dreams that the dead man had not dared to realize?  Here, from the
5377  fading canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl
5378  stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves.  A flower was in her right hand,
5379  and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses.  On
5380  a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple.  There were large
5381  green rosettes upon her little pointed shoes.  He knew her life, and
5382  the strange stories that were told about her lovers.  Had he something
5383  of her temperament in him?  These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to
5384  look curiously at him.  What of George Willoughby, with his powdered
5385  hair and fantastic patches?  How evil he looked!  The face was
5386  saturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with
5387  disdain.  Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that
5388  were so overladen with rings.  He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth
5389  century, and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars.  What of the
5390  second Lord Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his
5391  wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs.
5392  Fitzherbert?  How proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls
5393  and insolent pose!  What passions had he bequeathed?  The world had
5394  looked upon him as infamous.  He had led the orgies at Carlton House.
5395  The star of the Garter glittered upon his breast.  Beside him hung the
5396  portrait of his wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black.  Her blood,
5397  also, stirred within him.  How curious it all seemed!  And his mother
5398  with her Lady Hamilton face and her moist, wine-dashed lips--he knew
5399  what he had got from her.  He had got from her his beauty, and his
5400  passion for the beauty of others.  She laughed at him in her loose
5401  Bacchante dress.  There were vine leaves in her hair.  The purple
5402  spilled from the cup she was holding.  The carnations of the painting
5403  had withered, but the eyes were still wonderful in their depth and
5404  brilliancy of colour.  They seemed to follow him wherever he went.
5405  
5406  Yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one's own race,
5407  nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly
5408  with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious.  There
5409  were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history
5410  was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act
5411  and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it
5412  had been in his brain and in his passions.  He felt that he had known
5413  them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the
5414  stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of
5415  subtlety.  It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had
5416  been his own.
5417  
5418  The hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life had
5419  himself known this curious fancy.  In the seventh chapter he tells how,
5420  crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he had sat, as
5421  Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of
5422  Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him and the
5423  flute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had
5424  caroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their stables and supped in
5425  an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had
5426  wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round
5427  with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his
5428  days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible _taedium vitae_, that comes
5429  on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear
5430  emerald at the red shambles of the circus and then, in a litter of
5431  pearl and purple drawn by silver-shod mules, been carried through the
5432  Street of Pomegranates to a House of Gold and heard men cry on Nero
5433  Caesar as he passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his face with
5434  colours, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon
5435  from Carthage and given her in mystic marriage to the Sun.
5436  
5437  Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the
5438  two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious
5439  tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and
5440  beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made
5441  monstrous or mad:  Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife and
5442  painted her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death
5443  from the dead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as
5444  Paul the Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of
5445  Formosus, and whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was
5446  bought at the price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used
5447  hounds to chase living men and whose murdered body was covered with
5448  roses by a harlot who had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse,
5449  with Fratricide riding beside him and his mantle stained with the blood
5450  of Perotto; Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence,
5451  child and minion of Sixtus IV, whose beauty was equalled only by his
5452  debauchery, and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white
5453  and crimson silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy
5454  that he might serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose
5455  melancholy could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a
5456  passion for red blood, as other men have for red wine--the son of the
5457  Fiend, as was reported, and one who had cheated his father at dice when
5458  gambling with him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery
5459  took the name of Innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of
5460  three lads was infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the
5461  lover of Isotta and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome
5462  as the enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and
5463  gave poison to Ginevra d'Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a
5464  shameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles
5465  VI, who had so wildly adored his brother's wife that a leper had warned
5466  him of the insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his brain had
5467  sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen cards
5468  painted with the images of love and death and madness; and, in his
5469  trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto
5470  Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his page,
5471  and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the yellow
5472  piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose but weep,
5473  and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.
5474  
5475  There was a horrible fascination in them all.  He saw them at night,
5476  and they troubled his imagination in the day.  The Renaissance knew of
5477  strange manners of poisoning--poisoning by a helmet and a lighted
5478  torch, by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded pomander
5479  and by an amber chain.  Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book.  There
5480  were moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he
5481  could realize his conception of the beautiful.
5482  
5483  
5484  
5485  CHAPTER 12
5486  
5487  It was on the ninth of November, the eve of his own thirty-eighth
5488  birthday, as he often remembered afterwards.
5489  
5490  He was walking home about eleven o'clock from Lord Henry's, where he
5491  had been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the night was cold
5492  and foggy.  At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street,
5493  a man passed him in the mist, walking very fast and with the collar of
5494  his grey ulster turned up.  He had a bag in his hand.  Dorian
5495  recognized him.  It was Basil Hallward.  A strange sense of fear, for
5496  which he could not account, came over him.  He made no sign of
5497  recognition and went on quickly in the direction of his own house.
5498  
5499  But Hallward had seen him.  Dorian heard him first stopping on the
5500  pavement and then hurrying after him.  In a few moments, his hand was
5501  on his arm.
5502  
5503  "Dorian!  What an extraordinary piece of luck!  I have been waiting for
5504  you in your library ever since nine o'clock. Finally I took pity on
5505  your tired servant and told him to go to bed, as he let me out.  I am
5506  off to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly wanted to see
5507  you before I left.  I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as
5508  you passed me.  But I wasn't quite sure.  Didn't you recognize me?"
5509  
5510  "In this fog, my dear Basil?  Why, I can't even recognize Grosvenor
5511  Square.  I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I don't feel
5512  at all certain about it.  I am sorry you are going away, as I have not
5513  seen you for ages.  But I suppose you will be back soon?"
5514  
5515  "No:  I am going to be out of England for six months.  I intend to take
5516  a studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great
5517  picture I have in my head.  However, it wasn't about myself I wanted to
5518  talk.  Here we are at your door.  Let me come in for a moment.  I have
5519  something to say to you."
5520  
5521  "I shall be charmed.  But won't you miss your train?" said Dorian Gray
5522  languidly as he passed up the steps and opened the door with his
5523  latch-key.
5524  
5525  The lamplight struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at his
5526  watch.  "I have heaps of time," he answered.  "The train doesn't go
5527  till twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven.  In fact, I was on my
5528  way to the club to look for you, when I met you.  You see, I shan't
5529  have any delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things.  All I
5530  have with me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty
5531  minutes."
5532  
5533  Dorian looked at him and smiled.  "What a way for a fashionable painter
5534  to travel!  A Gladstone bag and an ulster!  Come in, or the fog will
5535  get into the house.  And mind you don't talk about anything serious.
5536  Nothing is serious nowadays.  At least nothing should be."
5537  
5538  Hallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into the
5539  library.  There was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open
5540  hearth.  The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case
5541  stood, with some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass tumblers, on
5542  a little marqueterie table.
5543  
5544  "You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian.  He gave me
5545  everything I wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes.  He is
5546  a most hospitable creature.  I like him much better than the Frenchman
5547  you used to have.  What has become of the Frenchman, by the bye?"
5548  
5549  Dorian shrugged his shoulders.  "I believe he married Lady Radley's
5550  maid, and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker.
5551  Anglomania is very fashionable over there now, I hear.  It seems silly
5552  of the French, doesn't it?  But--do you know?--he was not at all a bad
5553  servant.  I never liked him, but I had nothing to complain about.  One
5554  often imagines things that are quite absurd.  He was really very
5555  devoted to me and seemed quite sorry when he went away.  Have another
5556  brandy-and-soda? Or would you like hock-and-seltzer? I always take
5557  hock-and-seltzer myself.  There is sure to be some in the next room."
5558  
5559  "Thanks, I won't have anything more," said the painter, taking his cap
5560  and coat off and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in the
5561  corner.  "And now, my dear fellow, I want to speak to you seriously.
5562  Don't frown like that.  You make it so much more difficult for me."
5563  
5564  "What is it all about?" cried Dorian in his petulant way, flinging
5565  himself down on the sofa.  "I hope it is not about myself.  I am tired
5566  of myself to-night. I should like to be somebody else."
5567  
5568  "It is about yourself," answered Hallward in his grave deep voice, "and
5569  I must say it to you.  I shall only keep you half an hour."
5570  
5571  Dorian sighed and lit a cigarette.  "Half an hour!" he murmured.
5572  
5573  "It is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for your own
5574  sake that I am speaking.  I think it right that you should know that
5575  the most dreadful things are being said against you in London."
5576  
5577  "I don't wish to know anything about them.  I love scandals about other
5578  people, but scandals about myself don't interest me.  They have not got
5579  the charm of novelty."
5580  
5581  "They must interest you, Dorian.  Every gentleman is interested in his
5582  good name.  You don't want people to talk of you as something vile and
5583  degraded.  Of course, you have your position, and your wealth, and all
5584  that kind of thing.  But position and wealth are not everything.  Mind
5585  you, I don't believe these rumours at all.  At least, I can't believe
5586  them when I see you.  Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man's
5587  face.  It cannot be concealed.  People talk sometimes of secret vices.
5588  There are no such things.  If a wretched man has a vice, it shows
5589  itself in the lines of his mouth, the droop of his eyelids, the
5590  moulding of his hands even.  Somebody--I won't mention his name, but
5591  you know him--came to me last year to have his portrait done.  I had
5592  never seen him before, and had never heard anything about him at the
5593  time, though I have heard a good deal since.  He offered an extravagant
5594  price.  I refused him.  There was something in the shape of his fingers
5595  that I hated.  I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied
5596  about him.  His life is dreadful.  But you, Dorian, with your pure,
5597  bright, innocent face, and your marvellous untroubled youth--I can't
5598  believe anything against you.  And yet I see you very seldom, and you
5599  never come down to the studio now, and when I am away from you, and I
5600  hear all these hideous things that people are whispering about you, I
5601  don't know what to say.  Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of
5602  Berwick leaves the room of a club when you enter it?  Why is it that so
5603  many gentlemen in London will neither go to your house or invite you to
5604  theirs?  You used to be a friend of Lord Staveley.  I met him at dinner
5605  last week.  Your name happened to come up in conversation, in
5606  connection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the
5607  Dudley.  Staveley curled his lip and said that you might have the most
5608  artistic tastes, but that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl
5609  should be allowed to know, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the
5610  same room with.  I reminded him that I was a friend of yours, and asked
5611  him what he meant.  He told me.  He told me right out before everybody.
5612  It was horrible!  Why is your friendship so fatal to young men?  There
5613  was that wretched boy in the Guards who committed suicide.  You were
5614  his great friend.  There was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England
5615  with a tarnished name.  You and he were inseparable.  What about Adrian
5616  Singleton and his dreadful end?  What about Lord Kent's only son and
5617  his career?  I met his father yesterday in St. James's Street.  He
5618  seemed broken with shame and sorrow.  What about the young Duke of
5619  Perth?  What sort of life has he got now?  What gentleman would
5620  associate with him?"
5621  
5622  "Stop, Basil.  You are talking about things of which you know nothing,"
5623  said Dorian Gray, biting his lip, and with a note of infinite contempt
5624  in his voice.  "You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter it.
5625  It is because I know everything about his life, not because he knows
5626  anything about mine.  With such blood as he has in his veins, how could
5627  his record be clean?  You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth.
5628  Did I teach the one his vices, and the other his debauchery?  If Kent's
5629  silly son takes his wife from the streets, what is that to me?  If
5630  Adrian Singleton writes his friend's name across a bill, am I his
5631  keeper?  I know how people chatter in England.  The middle classes air
5632  their moral prejudices over their gross dinner-tables, and whisper
5633  about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try
5634  and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with
5635  the people they slander.  In this country, it is enough for a man to
5636  have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him.
5637  And what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead
5638  themselves?  My dear fellow, you forget that we are in the native land
5639  of the hypocrite."
5640  
5641  "Dorian," cried Hallward, "that is not the question.  England is bad
5642  enough I know, and English society is all wrong.  That is the reason
5643  why I want you to be fine.  You have not been fine.  One has a right to
5644  judge of a man by the effect he has over his friends.  Yours seem to
5645  lose all sense of honour, of goodness, of purity.  You have filled them
5646  with a madness for pleasure.  They have gone down into the depths.  You
5647  led them there.  Yes:  you led them there, and yet you can smile, as
5648  you are smiling now.  And there is worse behind.  I know you and Harry
5649  are inseparable.  Surely for that reason, if for none other, you should
5650  not have made his sister's name a by-word."
5651  
5652  "Take care, Basil.  You go too far."
5653  
5654  "I must speak, and you must listen.  You shall listen.  When you met
5655  Lady Gwendolen, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her.  Is there
5656  a single decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the
5657  park?  Why, even her children are not allowed to live with her.  Then
5658  there are other stories--stories that you have been seen creeping at
5659  dawn out of dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest
5660  dens in London.  Are they true?  Can they be true?  When I first heard
5661  them, I laughed.  I hear them now, and they make me shudder.  What
5662  about your country-house and the life that is led there?  Dorian, you
5663  don't know what is said about you.  I won't tell you that I don't want
5664  to preach to you.  I remember Harry saying once that every man who
5665  turned himself into an amateur curate for the moment always began by
5666  saying that, and then proceeded to break his word.  I do want to preach
5667  to you.  I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect
5668  you.  I want you to have a clean name and a fair record.  I want you to
5669  get rid of the dreadful people you associate with.  Don't shrug your
5670  shoulders like that.  Don't be so indifferent.  You have a wonderful
5671  influence.  Let it be for good, not for evil.  They say that you
5672  corrupt every one with whom you become intimate, and that it is quite
5673  sufficient for you to enter a house for shame of some kind to follow
5674  after.  I don't know whether it is so or not.  How should I know?  But
5675  it is said of you.  I am told things that it seems impossible to doubt.
5676  Lord Gloucester was one of my greatest friends at Oxford.  He showed me
5677  a letter that his wife had written to him when she was dying alone in
5678  her villa at Mentone.  Your name was implicated in the most terrible
5679  confession I ever read.  I told him that it was absurd--that I knew you
5680  thoroughly and that you were incapable of anything of the kind.  Know
5681  you?  I wonder do I know you?  Before I could answer that, I should
5682  have to see your soul."
5683  
5684  "To see my soul!" muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa and
5685  turning almost white from fear.
5686  
5687  "Yes," answered Hallward gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in his
5688  voice, "to see your soul.  But only God can do that."
5689  
5690  A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man.  "You
5691  shall see it yourself, to-night!" he cried, seizing a lamp from the
5692  table.  "Come:  it is your own handiwork.  Why shouldn't you look at
5693  it?  You can tell the world all about it afterwards, if you choose.
5694  Nobody would believe you.  If they did believe you, they would like me
5695  all the better for it.  I know the age better than you do, though you
5696  will prate about it so tediously.  Come, I tell you.  You have
5697  chattered enough about corruption.  Now you shall look on it face to
5698  face."
5699  
5700  There was the madness of pride in every word he uttered.  He stamped
5701  his foot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner.  He felt a
5702  terrible joy at the thought that some one else was to share his secret,
5703  and that the man who had painted the portrait that was the origin of
5704  all his shame was to be burdened for the rest of his life with the
5705  hideous memory of what he had done.
5706  
5707  "Yes," he continued, coming closer to him and looking steadfastly into
5708  his stern eyes, "I shall show you my soul.  You shall see the thing
5709  that you fancy only God can see."
5710  
5711  Hallward started back.  "This is blasphemy, Dorian!" he cried.  "You
5712  must not say things like that.  They are horrible, and they don't mean
5713  anything."
5714  
5715  "You think so?"  He laughed again.
5716  
5717  "I know so.  As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for your
5718  good.  You know I have been always a stanch friend to you."
5719  
5720  "Don't touch me.  Finish what you have to say."
5721  
5722  A twisted flash of pain shot across the painter's face.  He paused for
5723  a moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him.  After all, what
5724  right had he to pry into the life of Dorian Gray?  If he had done a
5725  tithe of what was rumoured about him, how much he must have suffered!
5726  Then he straightened himself up, and walked over to the fire-place, and
5727  stood there, looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and
5728  their throbbing cores of flame.
5729  
5730  "I am waiting, Basil," said the young man in a hard clear voice.
5731  
5732  He turned round.  "What I have to say is this," he cried.  "You must
5733  give me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against
5734  you.  If you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to
5735  end, I shall believe you.  Deny them, Dorian, deny them!  Can't you see
5736  what I am going through?  My God! don't tell me that you are bad, and
5737  corrupt, and shameful."
5738  
5739  Dorian Gray smiled.  There was a curl of contempt in his lips.  "Come
5740  upstairs, Basil," he said quietly.  "I keep a diary of my life from day
5741  to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written.  I shall
5742  show it to you if you come with me."
5743  
5744  "I shall come with you, Dorian, if you wish it.  I see I have missed my
5745  train.  That makes no matter.  I can go to-morrow. But don't ask me to
5746  read anything to-night. All I want is a plain answer to my question."
5747  
5748  "That shall be given to you upstairs.  I could not give it here.  You
5749  will not have to read long."
5750  
5751  
5752  
5753  CHAPTER 13
5754  
5755  He passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward
5756  following close behind.  They walked softly, as men do instinctively at
5757  night.  The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase.  A
5758  rising wind made some of the windows rattle.
5759  
5760  When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the
5761  floor, and taking out the key, turned it in the lock.  "You insist on
5762  knowing, Basil?" he asked in a low voice.
5763  
5764  "Yes."
5765  
5766  "I am delighted," he answered, smiling.  Then he added, somewhat
5767  harshly, "You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know
5768  everything about me.  You have had more to do with my life than you
5769  think"; and, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in.  A
5770  cold current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in
5771  a flame of murky orange.  He shuddered.  "Shut the door behind you," he
5772  whispered, as he placed the lamp on the table.
5773  
5774  Hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression.  The room looked
5775  as if it had not been lived in for years.  A faded Flemish tapestry, a
5776  curtained picture, an old Italian _cassone_, and an almost empty
5777  book-case--that was all that it seemed to contain, besides a chair and
5778  a table.  As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle that was
5779  standing on the mantelshelf, he saw that the whole place was covered
5780  with dust and that the carpet was in holes.  A mouse ran scuffling
5781  behind the wainscoting.  There was a damp odour of mildew.
5782  
5783  "So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil?  Draw that
5784  curtain back, and you will see mine."
5785  
5786  The voice that spoke was cold and cruel.  "You are mad, Dorian, or
5787  playing a part," muttered Hallward, frowning.
5788  
5789  "You won't? Then I must do it myself," said the young man, and he tore
5790  the curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground.
5791  
5792  An exclamation of horror broke from the painter's lips as he saw in the
5793  dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him.  There was
5794  something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing.
5795  Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray's own face that he was looking at!
5796  The horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled that
5797  marvellous beauty.  There was still some gold in the thinning hair and
5798  some scarlet on the sensual mouth.  The sodden eyes had kept something
5799  of the loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet
5800  completely passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat.
5801  Yes, it was Dorian himself.  But who had done it?  He seemed to
5802  recognize his own brushwork, and the frame was his own design.  The
5803  idea was monstrous, yet he felt afraid.  He seized the lighted candle,
5804  and held it to the picture.  In the left-hand corner was his own name,
5805  traced in long letters of bright vermilion.
5806  
5807  It was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire.  He had never
5808  done that.  Still, it was his own picture.  He knew it, and he felt as
5809  if his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice.  His
5810  own picture!  What did it mean?  Why had it altered?  He turned and
5811  looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man.  His mouth twitched,
5812  and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate.  He passed his hand
5813  across his forehead.  It was dank with clammy sweat.
5814  
5815  The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him with
5816  that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are
5817  absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting.  There was neither
5818  real sorrow in it nor real joy.  There was simply the passion of the
5819  spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes.  He had taken
5820  the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do so.
5821  
5822  "What does this mean?" cried Hallward, at last.  His own voice sounded
5823  shrill and curious in his ears.
5824  
5825  "Years ago, when I was a boy," said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in
5826  his hand, "you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my
5827  good looks.  One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who
5828  explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me
5829  that revealed to me the wonder of beauty.  In a mad moment that, even
5830  now, I don't know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you
5831  would call it a prayer...."
5832  
5833  "I remember it!  Oh, how well I remember it!  No! the thing is
5834  impossible.  The room is damp.  Mildew has got into the canvas.  The
5835  paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them.  I tell you the
5836  thing is impossible."
5837  
5838  "Ah, what is impossible?" murmured the young man, going over to the
5839  window and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained glass.
5840  
5841  "You told me you had destroyed it."
5842  
5843  "I was wrong.  It has destroyed me."
5844  
5845  "I don't believe it is my picture."
5846  
5847  "Can't you see your ideal in it?" said Dorian bitterly.
5848  
5849  "My ideal, as you call it..."
5850  
5851  "As you called it."
5852  
5853  "There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful.  You were to me such
5854  an ideal as I shall never meet again.  This is the face of a satyr."
5855  
5856  "It is the face of my soul."
5857  
5858  "Christ! what a thing I must have worshipped!  It has the eyes of a
5859  devil."
5860  
5861  "Each of us has heaven and hell in him, Basil," cried Dorian with a
5862  wild gesture of despair.
5863  
5864  Hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it.  "My God!  If it
5865  is true," he exclaimed, "and this is what you have done with your life,
5866  why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you
5867  to be!" He held the light up again to the canvas and examined it.  The
5868  surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it.  It was
5869  from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come.
5870  Through some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were
5871  slowly eating the thing away.  The rotting of a corpse in a watery
5872  grave was not so fearful.
5873  
5874  His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and
5875  lay there sputtering.  He placed his foot on it and put it out.  Then
5876  he flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table
5877  and buried his face in his hands.
5878  
5879  "Good God, Dorian, what a lesson!  What an awful lesson!" There was no
5880  answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window.  "Pray,
5881  Dorian, pray," he murmured.  "What is it that one was taught to say in
5882  one's boyhood?  'Lead us not into temptation.  Forgive us our sins.
5883  Wash away our iniquities.'  Let us say that together.  The prayer of
5884  your pride has been answered.  The prayer of your repentance will be
5885  answered also.  I worshipped you too much.  I am punished for it.  You
5886  worshipped yourself too much.  We are both punished."
5887  
5888  Dorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him with tear-dimmed
5889  eyes.  "It is too late, Basil," he faltered.
5890  
5891  "It is never too late, Dorian.  Let us kneel down and try if we cannot
5892  remember a prayer.  Isn't there a verse somewhere, 'Though your sins be
5893  as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow'?"
5894  
5895  "Those words mean nothing to me now."
5896  
5897  "Hush!  Don't say that.  You have done enough evil in your life.  My
5898  God!  Don't you see that accursed thing leering at us?"
5899  
5900  Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable
5901  feeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him, as though it had
5902  been suggested to him by the image on the canvas, whispered into his
5903  ear by those grinning lips.  The mad passions of a hunted animal
5904  stirred within him, and he loathed the man who was seated at the table,
5905  more than in his whole life he had ever loathed anything.  He glanced
5906  wildly around.  Something glimmered on the top of the painted chest
5907  that faced him.  His eye fell on it.  He knew what it was.  It was a
5908  knife that he had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord,
5909  and had forgotten to take away with him.  He moved slowly towards it,
5910  passing Hallward as he did so.  As soon as he got behind him, he seized
5911  it and turned round.  Hallward stirred in his chair as if he was going
5912  to rise.  He rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that
5913  is behind the ear, crushing the man's head down on the table and
5914  stabbing again and again.
5915  
5916  There was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking
5917  with blood.  Three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively,
5918  waving grotesque, stiff-fingered hands in the air.  He stabbed him
5919  twice more, but the man did not move.  Something began to trickle on
5920  the floor.  He waited for a moment, still pressing the head down.  Then
5921  he threw the knife on the table, and listened.
5922  
5923  He could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet.  He
5924  opened the door and went out on the landing.  The house was absolutely
5925  quiet.  No one was about.  For a few seconds he stood bending over the
5926  balustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness.
5927  Then he took out the key and returned to the room, locking himself in
5928  as he did so.
5929  
5930  The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with
5931  bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms.  Had it not been
5932  for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was
5933  slowly widening on the table, one would have said that the man was
5934  simply asleep.
5935  
5936  How quickly it had all been done!  He felt strangely calm, and walking
5937  over to the window, opened it and stepped out on the balcony.  The wind
5938  had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacock's
5939  tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes.  He looked down and saw the
5940  policeman going his rounds and flashing the long beam of his lantern on
5941  the doors of the silent houses.  The crimson spot of a prowling hansom
5942  gleamed at the corner and then vanished.  A woman in a fluttering shawl
5943  was creeping slowly by the railings, staggering as she went.  Now and
5944  then she stopped and peered back.  Once, she began to sing in a hoarse
5945  voice.  The policeman strolled over and said something to her.  She
5946  stumbled away, laughing.  A bitter blast swept across the square.  The
5947  gas-lamps flickered and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their
5948  black iron branches to and fro.  He shivered and went back, closing the
5949  window behind him.
5950  
5951  Having reached the door, he turned the key and opened it.  He did not
5952  even glance at the murdered man.  He felt that the secret of the whole
5953  thing was not to realize the situation.  The friend who had painted the
5954  fatal portrait to which all his misery had been due had gone out of his
5955  life.  That was enough.
5956  
5957  Then he remembered the lamp.  It was a rather curious one of Moorish
5958  workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished
5959  steel, and studded with coarse turquoises.  Perhaps it might be missed
5960  by his servant, and questions would be asked.  He hesitated for a
5961  moment, then he turned back and took it from the table.  He could not
5962  help seeing the dead thing.  How still it was!  How horribly white the
5963  long hands looked!  It was like a dreadful wax image.
5964  
5965  Having locked the door behind him, he crept quietly downstairs.  The
5966  woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain.  He stopped
5967  several times and waited.  No:  everything was still.  It was merely
5968  the sound of his own footsteps.
5969  
5970  When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner.
5971  They must be hidden away somewhere.  He unlocked a secret press that
5972  was in the wainscoting, a press in which he kept his own curious
5973  disguises, and put them into it.  He could easily burn them afterwards.
5974  Then he pulled out his watch.  It was twenty minutes to two.
5975  
5976  He sat down and began to think.  Every year--every month, almost--men
5977  were strangled in England for what he had done.  There had been a
5978  madness of murder in the air.  Some red star had come too close to the
5979  earth.... And yet, what evidence was there against him?  Basil Hallward
5980  had left the house at eleven.  No one had seen him come in again.  Most
5981  of the servants were at Selby Royal.  His valet had gone to bed....
5982  Paris!  Yes.  It was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight
5983  train, as he had intended.  With his curious reserved habits, it would
5984  be months before any suspicions would be roused.  Months!  Everything
5985  could be destroyed long before then.
5986  
5987  A sudden thought struck him.  He put on his fur coat and hat and went
5988  out into the hall.  There he paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of
5989  the policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the
5990  bull's-eye reflected in the window.  He waited and held his breath.
5991  
5992  After a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out, shutting
5993  the door very gently behind him.  Then he began ringing the bell.  In
5994  about five minutes his valet appeared, half-dressed and looking very
5995  drowsy.
5996  
5997  "I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis," he said, stepping in;
5998  "but I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?"
5999  
6000  "Ten minutes past two, sir," answered the man, looking at the clock and
6001  blinking.
6002  
6003  "Ten minutes past two?  How horribly late!  You must wake me at nine
6004  to-morrow. I have some work to do."
6005  
6006  "All right, sir."
6007  
6008  "Did any one call this evening?"
6009  
6010  "Mr. Hallward, sir.  He stayed here till eleven, and then he went away
6011  to catch his train."
6012  
6013  "Oh!  I am sorry I didn't see him.  Did he leave any message?"
6014  
6015  "No, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris, if he did not
6016  find you at the club."
6017  
6018  "That will do, Francis.  Don't forget to call me at nine to-morrow."
6019  
6020  "No, sir."
6021  
6022  The man shambled down the passage in his slippers.
6023  
6024  Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed into the
6025  library.  For a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room,
6026  biting his lip and thinking.  Then he took down the Blue Book from one
6027  of the shelves and began to turn over the leaves.  "Alan Campbell, 152,
6028  Hertford Street, Mayfair."  Yes; that was the man he wanted.
6029  
6030  
6031  
6032  CHAPTER 14
6033  
6034  At nine o'clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of
6035  chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters.  Dorian was sleeping quite
6036  peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath his
6037  cheek.  He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study.
6038  
6039  The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as
6040  he opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he
6041  had been lost in some delightful dream.  Yet he had not dreamed at all.
6042  His night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain.
6043  But youth smiles without any reason.  It is one of its chiefest charms.
6044  
6045  He turned round, and leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his
6046  chocolate.  The mellow November sun came streaming into the room.  The
6047  sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air.  It was
6048  almost like a morning in May.
6049  
6050  Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent,
6051  blood-stained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there
6052  with terrible distinctness.  He winced at the memory of all that he had
6053  suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for
6054  Basil Hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came
6055  back to him, and he grew cold with passion.  The dead man was still
6056  sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now.  How horrible that was!
6057  Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.
6058  
6059  He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken
6060  or grow mad.  There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory
6061  than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride
6062  more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of
6063  joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the
6064  senses.  But this was not one of them.  It was a thing to be driven out
6065  of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might
6066  strangle one itself.
6067  
6068  When the half-hour struck, he passed his hand across his forehead, and
6069  then got up hastily and dressed himself with even more than his usual
6070  care, giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his necktie and
6071  scarf-pin and changing his rings more than once.  He spent a long time
6072  also over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his valet
6073  about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the
6074  servants at Selby, and going through his correspondence.  At some of
6075  the letters, he smiled.  Three of them bored him.  One he read several
6076  times over and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his
6077  face.  "That awful thing, a woman's memory!" as Lord Henry had once
6078  said.
6079  
6080  After he had drunk his cup of black coffee, he wiped his lips slowly
6081  with a napkin, motioned to his servant to wait, and going over to the
6082  table, sat down and wrote two letters.  One he put in his pocket, the
6083  other he handed to the valet.
6084  
6085  "Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell
6086  is out of town, get his address."
6087  
6088  As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a
6089  piece of paper, drawing first flowers and bits of architecture, and
6090  then human faces.  Suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew
6091  seemed to have a fantastic likeness to Basil Hallward.  He frowned, and
6092  getting up, went over to the book-case and took out a volume at hazard.
6093  He was determined that he would not think about what had happened until
6094  it became absolutely necessary that he should do so.
6095  
6096  When he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the title-page
6097  of the book.  It was Gautier's Emaux et Camees, Charpentier's
6098  Japanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching.  The binding was
6099  of citron-green leather, with a design of gilt trellis-work and dotted
6100  pomegranates.  It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton.  As he
6101  turned over the pages, his eye fell on the poem about the hand of
6102  Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand "_du supplice encore mal lavee_," with
6103  its downy red hairs and its "_doigts de faune_."  He glanced at his own
6104  white taper fingers, shuddering slightly in spite of himself, and
6105  passed on, till he came to those lovely stanzas upon Venice:
6106  
6107       Sur une gamme chromatique,
6108         Le sein de peries ruisselant,
6109       La Venus de l'Adriatique
6110         Sort de l'eau son corps rose et blanc.
6111  
6112       Les domes, sur l'azur des ondes
6113         Suivant la phrase au pur contour,
6114       S'enflent comme des gorges rondes
6115         Que souleve un soupir d'amour.
6116  
6117       L'esquif aborde et me depose,
6118         Jetant son amarre au pilier,
6119       Devant une facade rose,
6120         Sur le marbre d'un escalier.
6121  
6122  
6123  How exquisite they were!  As one read them, one seemed to be floating
6124  down the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black
6125  gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains.  The mere lines looked
6126  to him like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that follow one as
6127  one pushes out to the Lido.  The sudden flashes of colour reminded him
6128  of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter round the
6129  tall honeycombed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through
6130  the dim, dust-stained arcades.  Leaning back with half-closed eyes, he
6131  kept saying over and over to himself:
6132  
6133       "Devant une facade rose,
6134          Sur le marbre d'un escalier."
6135  
6136  The whole of Venice was in those two lines.  He remembered the autumn
6137  that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him to
6138  mad delightful follies.  There was romance in every place.  But Venice,
6139  like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true
6140  romantic, background was everything, or almost everything.  Basil had
6141  been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret.  Poor
6142  Basil!  What a horrible way for a man to die!
6143  
6144  He sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget.  He read
6145  of the swallows that fly in and out of the little _cafe_ at Smyrna where
6146  the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned merchants
6147  smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each other; he
6148  read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps tears of
6149  granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by the hot,
6150  lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red ibises, and
6151  white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small beryl eyes
6152  that crawl over the green steaming mud; he began to brood over those
6153  verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell of that
6154  curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the "_monstre
6155  charmant_" that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.  But after a
6156  time the book fell from his hand.  He grew nervous, and a horrible fit
6157  of terror came over him.  What if Alan Campbell should be out of
6158  England?  Days would elapse before he could come back.  Perhaps he
6159  might refuse to come.  What could he do then?  Every moment was of
6160  vital importance.
6161  
6162  They had been great friends once, five years before--almost
6163  inseparable, indeed.  Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end.
6164  When they met in society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled:  Alan
6165  Campbell never did.
6166  
6167  He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real
6168  appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the
6169  beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian.  His
6170  dominant intellectual passion was for science.  At Cambridge he had
6171  spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and had taken
6172  a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year.  Indeed, he was
6173  still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his
6174  own in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the
6175  annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing for
6176  Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up
6177  prescriptions.  He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and
6178  played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs.  In
6179  fact, it was music that had first brought him and Dorian Gray
6180  together--music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to
6181  be able to exercise whenever he wished--and, indeed, exercised often
6182  without being conscious of it.  They had met at Lady Berkshire's the
6183  night that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always
6184  seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on.  For
6185  eighteen months their intimacy lasted.  Campbell was always either at
6186  Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square.  To him, as to many others, Dorian
6187  Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in
6188  life.  Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one
6189  ever knew.  But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when
6190  they met and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any
6191  party at which Dorian Gray was present.  He had changed, too--was
6192  strangely melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing
6193  music, and would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was
6194  called upon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time
6195  left in which to practise.  And this was certainly true.  Every day he
6196  seemed to become more interested in biology, and his name appeared once
6197  or twice in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain
6198  curious experiments.
6199  
6200  This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for.  Every second he kept
6201  glancing at the clock.  As the minutes went by he became horribly
6202  agitated.  At last he got up and began to pace up and down the room,
6203  looking like a beautiful caged thing.  He took long stealthy strides.
6204  His hands were curiously cold.
6205  
6206  The suspense became unbearable.  Time seemed to him to be crawling with
6207  feet of lead, while he by monstrous winds was being swept towards the
6208  jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice.  He knew what was waiting
6209  for him there; saw it, indeed, and, shuddering, crushed with dank hands
6210  his burning lids as though he would have robbed the very brain of sight
6211  and driven the eyeballs back into their cave.  It was useless.  The
6212  brain had its own food on which it battened, and the imagination, made
6213  grotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain,
6214  danced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving
6215  masks.  Then, suddenly, time stopped for him.  Yes:  that blind,
6216  slow-breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being
6217  dead, raced nimbly on in front, and dragged a hideous future from its
6218  grave, and showed it to him.  He stared at it.  Its very horror made
6219  him stone.
6220  
6221  At last the door opened and his servant entered.  He turned glazed eyes
6222  upon him.
6223  
6224  "Mr. Campbell, sir," said the man.
6225  
6226  A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the colour came back
6227  to his cheeks.
6228  
6229  "Ask him to come in at once, Francis."  He felt that he was himself
6230  again.  His mood of cowardice had passed away.
6231  
6232  The man bowed and retired.  In a few moments, Alan Campbell walked in,
6233  looking very stern and rather pale, his pallor being intensified by his
6234  coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.
6235  
6236  "Alan!  This is kind of you.  I thank you for coming."
6237  
6238  "I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray.  But you said it
6239  was a matter of life and death."  His voice was hard and cold.  He
6240  spoke with slow deliberation.  There was a look of contempt in the
6241  steady searching gaze that he turned on Dorian.  He kept his hands in
6242  the pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the
6243  gesture with which he had been greeted.
6244  
6245  "Yes:  it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one
6246  person.  Sit down."
6247  
6248  Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him.
6249  The two men's eyes met.  In Dorian's there was infinite pity.  He knew
6250  that what he was going to do was dreadful.
6251  
6252  After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very
6253  quietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of him he
6254  had sent for, "Alan, in a locked room at the top of this house, a room
6255  to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is seated at a table.
6256  He has been dead ten hours now.  Don't stir, and don't look at me like
6257  that.  Who the man is, why he died, how he died, are matters that do
6258  not concern you.  What you have to do is this--"
6259  
6260  "Stop, Gray.  I don't want to know anything further.  Whether what you
6261  have told me is true or not true doesn't concern me.  I entirely
6262  decline to be mixed up in your life.  Keep your horrible secrets to
6263  yourself.  They don't interest me any more."
6264  
6265  "Alan, they will have to interest you.  This one will have to interest
6266  you.  I am awfully sorry for you, Alan.  But I can't help myself.  You
6267  are the one man who is able to save me.  I am forced to bring you into
6268  the matter.  I have no option.  Alan, you are scientific.  You know
6269  about chemistry and things of that kind.  You have made experiments.
6270  What you have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs--to
6271  destroy it so that not a vestige of it will be left.  Nobody saw this
6272  person come into the house.  Indeed, at the present moment he is
6273  supposed to be in Paris.  He will not be missed for months.  When he is
6274  missed, there must be no trace of him found here.  You, Alan, you must
6275  change him, and everything that belongs to him, into a handful of ashes
6276  that I may scatter in the air."
6277  
6278  "You are mad, Dorian."
6279  
6280  "Ah!  I was waiting for you to call me Dorian."
6281  
6282  "You are mad, I tell you--mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to
6283  help you, mad to make this monstrous confession.  I will have nothing
6284  to do with this matter, whatever it is.  Do you think I am going to
6285  peril my reputation for you?  What is it to me what devil's work you
6286  are up to?"
6287  
6288  "It was suicide, Alan."
6289  
6290  "I am glad of that.  But who drove him to it?  You, I should fancy."
6291  
6292  "Do you still refuse to do this for me?"
6293  
6294  "Of course I refuse.  I will have absolutely nothing to do with it.  I
6295  don't care what shame comes on you.  You deserve it all.  I should not
6296  be sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced.  How dare you ask
6297  me, of all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror?  I should
6298  have thought you knew more about people's characters.  Your friend Lord
6299  Henry Wotton can't have taught you much about psychology, whatever else
6300  he has taught you.  Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you.
6301  You have come to the wrong man.  Go to some of your friends.  Don't
6302  come to me."
6303  
6304  "Alan, it was murder.  I killed him.  You don't know what he had made
6305  me suffer.  Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making or
6306  the marring of it than poor Harry has had.  He may not have intended
6307  it, the result was the same."
6308  
6309  "Murder!  Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to?  I shall not
6310  inform upon you.  It is not my business.  Besides, without my stirring
6311  in the matter, you are certain to be arrested.  Nobody ever commits a
6312  crime without doing something stupid.  But I will have nothing to do
6313  with it."
6314  
6315  "You must have something to do with it.  Wait, wait a moment; listen to
6316  me.  Only listen, Alan.  All I ask of you is to perform a certain
6317  scientific experiment.  You go to hospitals and dead-houses, and the
6318  horrors that you do there don't affect you.  If in some hideous
6319  dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a
6320  leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow
6321  through, you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject.  You
6322  would not turn a hair.  You would not believe that you were doing
6323  anything wrong.  On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were
6324  benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the
6325  world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind.
6326  What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before.
6327  Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are
6328  accustomed to work at.  And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence
6329  against me.  If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be
6330  discovered unless you help me."
6331  
6332  "I have no desire to help you.  You forget that.  I am simply
6333  indifferent to the whole thing.  It has nothing to do with me."
6334  
6335  "Alan, I entreat you.  Think of the position I am in.  Just before you
6336  came I almost fainted with terror.  You may know terror yourself some
6337  day.  No! don't think of that.  Look at the matter purely from the
6338  scientific point of view.  You don't inquire where the dead things on
6339  which you experiment come from.  Don't inquire now.  I have told you
6340  too much as it is.  But I beg of you to do this.  We were friends once,
6341  Alan."
6342  
6343  "Don't speak about those days, Dorian--they are dead."
6344  
6345  "The dead linger sometimes.  The man upstairs will not go away.  He is
6346  sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms.  Alan!
6347  Alan!  If you don't come to my assistance, I am ruined.  Why, they will
6348  hang me, Alan!  Don't you understand?  They will hang me for what I
6349  have done."
6350  
6351  "There is no good in prolonging this scene.  I absolutely refuse to do
6352  anything in the matter.  It is insane of you to ask me."
6353  
6354  "You refuse?"
6355  
6356  "Yes."
6357  
6358  "I entreat you, Alan."
6359  
6360  "It is useless."
6361  
6362  The same look of pity came into Dorian Gray's eyes.  Then he stretched
6363  out his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it.  He
6364  read it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the
6365  table.  Having done this, he got up and went over to the window.
6366  
6367  Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and
6368  opened it.  As he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he fell
6369  back in his chair.  A horrible sense of sickness came over him.  He
6370  felt as if his heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow.
6371  
6372  After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round and
6373  came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder.
6374  
6375  "I am so sorry for you, Alan," he murmured, "but you leave me no
6376  alternative.  I have a letter written already.  Here it is.  You see
6377  the address.  If you don't help me, I must send it.  If you don't help
6378  me, I will send it.  You know what the result will be.  But you are
6379  going to help me.  It is impossible for you to refuse now.  I tried to
6380  spare you.  You will do me the justice to admit that.  You were stern,
6381  harsh, offensive.  You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat
6382  me--no living man, at any rate.  I bore it all.  Now it is for me to
6383  dictate terms."
6384  
6385  Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through him.
6386  
6387  "Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan.  You know what they are.
6388  The thing is quite simple.  Come, don't work yourself into this fever.
6389  The thing has to be done.  Face it, and do it."
6390  
6391  A groan broke from Campbell's lips and he shivered all over.  The
6392  ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing
6393  time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to be
6394  borne.  He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his
6395  forehead, as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already
6396  come upon him.  The hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead.
6397  It was intolerable.  It seemed to crush him.
6398  
6399  "Come, Alan, you must decide at once."
6400  
6401  "I cannot do it," he said, mechanically, as though words could alter
6402  things.
6403  
6404  "You must.  You have no choice.  Don't delay."
6405  
6406  He hesitated a moment.  "Is there a fire in the room upstairs?"
6407  
6408  "Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos."
6409  
6410  "I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory."
6411  
6412  "No, Alan, you must not leave the house.  Write out on a sheet of
6413  notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the
6414  things back to you."
6415  
6416  Campbell scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope
6417  to his assistant.  Dorian took the note up and read it carefully.  Then
6418  he rang the bell and gave it to his valet, with orders to return as
6419  soon as possible and to bring the things with him.
6420  
6421  As the hall door shut, Campbell started nervously, and having got up
6422  from the chair, went over to the chimney-piece. He was shivering with a
6423  kind of ague.  For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke.  A
6424  fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was
6425  like the beat of a hammer.
6426  
6427  As the chime struck one, Campbell turned round, and looking at Dorian
6428  Gray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears.  There was something in
6429  the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him.
6430  "You are infamous, absolutely infamous!" he muttered.
6431  
6432  "Hush, Alan.  You have saved my life," said Dorian.
6433  
6434  "Your life?  Good heavens! what a life that is!  You have gone from
6435  corruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in crime.  In
6436  doing what I am going to do--what you force me to do--it is not of your
6437  life that I am thinking."
6438  
6439  "Ah, Alan," murmured Dorian with a sigh, "I wish you had a thousandth
6440  part of the pity for me that I have for you." He turned away as he
6441  spoke and stood looking out at the garden.  Campbell made no answer.
6442  
6443  After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant
6444  entered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long coil
6445  of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps.
6446  
6447  "Shall I leave the things here, sir?" he asked Campbell.
6448  
6449  "Yes," said Dorian.  "And I am afraid, Francis, that I have another
6450  errand for you.  What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies
6451  Selby with orchids?"
6452  
6453  "Harden, sir."
6454  
6455  "Yes--Harden.  You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden
6456  personally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered,
6457  and to have as few white ones as possible.  In fact, I don't want any
6458  white ones.  It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty
6459  place--otherwise I wouldn't bother you about it."
6460  
6461  "No trouble, sir.  At what time shall I be back?"
6462  
6463  Dorian looked at Campbell.  "How long will your experiment take, Alan?"
6464  he said in a calm indifferent voice.  The presence of a third person in
6465  the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.
6466  
6467  Campbell frowned and bit his lip.  "It will take about five hours," he
6468  answered.
6469  
6470  "It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past seven,
6471  Francis.  Or stay:  just leave my things out for dressing.  You can
6472  have the evening to yourself.  I am not dining at home, so I shall not
6473  want you."
6474  
6475  "Thank you, sir," said the man, leaving the room.
6476  
6477  "Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost.  How heavy this chest is!
6478  I'll take it for you.  You bring the other things."  He spoke rapidly
6479  and in an authoritative manner.  Campbell felt dominated by him.  They
6480  left the room together.
6481  
6482  When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned
6483  it in the lock.  Then he stopped, and a troubled look came into his
6484  eyes.  He shuddered.  "I don't think I can go in, Alan," he murmured.
6485  
6486  "It is nothing to me.  I don't require you," said Campbell coldly.
6487  
6488  Dorian half opened the door.  As he did so, he saw the face of his
6489  portrait leering in the sunlight.  On the floor in front of it the torn
6490  curtain was lying.  He remembered that the night before he had
6491  forgotten, for the first time in his life, to hide the fatal canvas,
6492  and was about to rush forward, when he drew back with a shudder.
6493  
6494  What was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening, on
6495  one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood?  How horrible
6496  it was!--more horrible, it seemed to him for the moment, than the
6497  silent thing that he knew was stretched across the table, the thing
6498  whose grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him that
6499  it had not stirred, but was still there, as he had left it.
6500  
6501  He heaved a deep breath, opened the door a little wider, and with
6502  half-closed eyes and averted head, walked quickly in, determined that
6503  he would not look even once upon the dead man.  Then, stooping down and
6504  taking up the gold-and-purple hanging, he flung it right over the
6505  picture.
6506  
6507  There he stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed
6508  themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him.  He heard
6509  Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other
6510  things that he had required for his dreadful work.  He began to wonder
6511  if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they had
6512  thought of each other.
6513  
6514  "Leave me now," said a stern voice behind him.
6515  
6516  He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been
6517  thrust back into the chair and that Campbell was gazing into a
6518  glistening yellow face.  As he was going downstairs, he heard the key
6519  being turned in the lock.
6520  
6521  It was long after seven when Campbell came back into the library.  He
6522  was pale, but absolutely calm.  "I have done what you asked me to do,"
6523  he muttered. "And now, good-bye. Let us never see each other again."
6524  
6525  "You have saved me from ruin, Alan.  I cannot forget that," said Dorian
6526  simply.
6527  
6528  As soon as Campbell had left, he went upstairs.  There was a horrible
6529  smell of nitric acid in the room.  But the thing that had been sitting
6530  at the table was gone.
6531  
6532  
6533  
6534  CHAPTER 15
6535  
6536  That evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large
6537  button-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady
6538  Narborough's drawing-room by bowing servants.  His forehead was
6539  throbbing with maddened nerves, and he felt wildly excited, but his
6540  manner as he bent over his hostess's hand was as easy and graceful as
6541  ever.  Perhaps one never seems so much at one's ease as when one has to
6542  play a part.  Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could
6543  have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any
6544  tragedy of our age.  Those finely shaped fingers could never have
6545  clutched a knife for sin, nor those smiling lips have cried out on God
6546  and goodness.  He himself could not help wondering at the calm of his
6547  demeanour, and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a
6548  double life.
6549  
6550  It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who
6551  was a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the
6552  remains of really remarkable ugliness.  She had proved an excellent
6553  wife to one of our most tedious ambassadors, and having buried her
6554  husband properly in a marble mausoleum, which she had herself designed,
6555  and married off her daughters to some rich, rather elderly men, she
6556  devoted herself now to the pleasures of French fiction, French cookery,
6557  and French _esprit_ when she could get it.
6558  
6559  Dorian was one of her especial favourites, and she always told him that
6560  she was extremely glad she had not met him in early life.  "I know, my
6561  dear, I should have fallen madly in love with you," she used to say,
6562  "and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake.  It is most
6563  fortunate that you were not thought of at the time.  As it was, our
6564  bonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were so occupied in trying to
6565  raise the wind, that I never had even a flirtation with anybody.
6566  However, that was all Narborough's fault.  He was dreadfully
6567  short-sighted, and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who
6568  never sees anything."
6569  
6570  Her guests this evening were rather tedious.  The fact was, as she
6571  explained to Dorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her married
6572  daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her, and, to make
6573  matters worse, had actually brought her husband with her.  "I think it
6574  is most unkind of her, my dear," she whispered.  "Of course I go and
6575  stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old
6576  woman like me must have fresh air sometimes, and besides, I really wake
6577  them up.  You don't know what an existence they lead down there.  It is
6578  pure unadulterated country life.  They get up early, because they have
6579  so much to do, and go to bed early, because they have so little to
6580  think about.  There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since
6581  the time of Queen Elizabeth, and consequently they all fall asleep
6582  after dinner.  You shan't sit next either of them.  You shall sit by me
6583  and amuse me."
6584  
6585  Dorian murmured a graceful compliment and looked round the room.  Yes:
6586  it was certainly a tedious party.  Two of the people he had never seen
6587  before, and the others consisted of Ernest Harrowden, one of those
6588  middle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have no enemies,
6589  but are thoroughly disliked by their friends; Lady Ruxton, an
6590  overdressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked nose, who was always
6591  trying to get herself compromised, but was so peculiarly plain that to
6592  her great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against
6593  her; Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with a delightful lisp and
6594  Venetian-red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his hostess's daughter, a dowdy
6595  dull girl, with one of those characteristic British faces that, once
6596  seen, are never remembered; and her husband, a red-cheeked,
6597  white-whiskered creature who, like so many of his class, was under the
6598  impression that inordinate joviality can atone for an entire lack of
6599  ideas.
6600  
6601  He was rather sorry he had come, till Lady Narborough, looking at the
6602  great ormolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the
6603  mauve-draped mantelshelf, exclaimed:  "How horrid of Henry Wotton to be
6604  so late!  I sent round to him this morning on chance and he promised
6605  faithfully not to disappoint me."
6606  
6607  It was some consolation that Harry was to be there, and when the door
6608  opened and he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to some
6609  insincere apology, he ceased to feel bored.
6610  
6611  But at dinner he could not eat anything.  Plate after plate went away
6612  untasted.  Lady Narborough kept scolding him for what she called "an
6613  insult to poor Adolphe, who invented the _menu_ specially for you," and
6614  now and then Lord Henry looked across at him, wondering at his silence
6615  and abstracted manner.  From time to time the butler filled his glass
6616  with champagne.  He drank eagerly, and his thirst seemed to increase.
6617  
6618  "Dorian," said Lord Henry at last, as the _chaud-froid_ was being handed
6619  round, "what is the matter with you to-night? You are quite out of
6620  sorts."
6621  
6622  "I believe he is in love," cried Lady Narborough, "and that he is
6623  afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous.  He is quite right.  I
6624  certainly should."
6625  
6626  "Dear Lady Narborough," murmured Dorian, smiling, "I have not been in
6627  love for a whole week--not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol left town."
6628  
6629  "How you men can fall in love with that woman!" exclaimed the old lady.
6630  "I really cannot understand it."
6631  
6632  "It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl,
6633  Lady Narborough," said Lord Henry.  "She is the one link between us and
6634  your short frocks."
6635  
6636  "She does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry.  But I
6637  remember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how _decolletee_
6638  she was then."
6639  
6640  "She is still _decolletee_," he answered, taking an olive in his long
6641  fingers; "and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an
6642  _edition de luxe_ of a bad French novel.  She is really wonderful, and
6643  full of surprises.  Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary.
6644  When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief."
6645  
6646  "How can you, Harry!" cried Dorian.
6647  
6648  "It is a most romantic explanation," laughed the hostess.  "But her
6649  third husband, Lord Henry!  You don't mean to say Ferrol is the fourth?"
6650  
6651  "Certainly, Lady Narborough."
6652  
6653  "I don't believe a word of it."
6654  
6655  "Well, ask Mr. Gray.  He is one of her most intimate friends."
6656  
6657  "Is it true, Mr. Gray?"
6658  
6659  "She assures me so, Lady Narborough," said Dorian.  "I asked her
6660  whether, like Marguerite de Navarre, she had their hearts embalmed and
6661  hung at her girdle.  She told me she didn't, because none of them had
6662  had any hearts at all."
6663  
6664  "Four husbands!  Upon my word that is _trop de zele_."
6665  
6666  "_Trop d'audace_, I tell her," said Dorian.
6667  
6668  "Oh! she is audacious enough for anything, my dear.  And what is Ferrol
6669  like?  I don't know him."
6670  
6671  "The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes,"
6672  said Lord Henry, sipping his wine.
6673  
6674  Lady Narborough hit him with her fan.  "Lord Henry, I am not at all
6675  surprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked."
6676  
6677  "But what world says that?" asked Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows.
6678  "It can only be the next world.  This world and I are on excellent
6679  terms."
6680  
6681  "Everybody I know says you are very wicked," cried the old lady,
6682  shaking her head.
6683  
6684  Lord Henry looked serious for some moments.  "It is perfectly
6685  monstrous," he said, at last, "the way people go about nowadays saying
6686  things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely
6687  true."
6688  
6689  "Isn't he incorrigible?" cried Dorian, leaning forward in his chair.
6690  
6691  "I hope so," said his hostess, laughing.  "But really, if you all
6692  worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way, I shall have to marry
6693  again so as to be in the fashion."
6694  
6695  "You will never marry again, Lady Narborough," broke in Lord Henry.
6696  "You were far too happy.  When a woman marries again, it is because she
6697  detested her first husband.  When a man marries again, it is because he
6698  adored his first wife.  Women try their luck; men risk theirs."
6699  
6700  "Narborough wasn't perfect," cried the old lady.
6701  
6702  "If he had been, you would not have loved him, my dear lady," was the
6703  rejoinder.  "Women love us for our defects.  If we have enough of them,
6704  they will forgive us everything, even our intellects.  You will never
6705  ask me to dinner again after saying this, I am afraid, Lady Narborough,
6706  but it is quite true."
6707  
6708  "Of course it is true, Lord Henry.  If we women did not love you for
6709  your defects, where would you all be?  Not one of you would ever be
6710  married.  You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors.  Not, however,
6711  that that would alter you much.  Nowadays all the married men live like
6712  bachelors, and all the bachelors like married men."
6713  
6714  "_Fin de siecle_," murmured Lord Henry.
6715  
6716  "_Fin du globe_," answered his hostess.
6717  
6718  "I wish it were _fin du globe_," said Dorian with a sigh.  "Life is a
6719  great disappointment."
6720  
6721  "Ah, my dear," cried Lady Narborough, putting on her gloves, "don't
6722  tell me that you have exhausted life.  When a man says that one knows
6723  that life has exhausted him.  Lord Henry is very wicked, and I
6724  sometimes wish that I had been; but you are made to be good--you look
6725  so good.  I must find you a nice wife.  Lord Henry, don't you think
6726  that Mr. Gray should get married?"
6727  
6728  "I am always telling him so, Lady Narborough," said Lord Henry with a
6729  bow.
6730  
6731  "Well, we must look out for a suitable match for him.  I shall go
6732  through Debrett carefully to-night and draw out a list of all the
6733  eligible young ladies."
6734  
6735  "With their ages, Lady Narborough?" asked Dorian.
6736  
6737  "Of course, with their ages, slightly edited.  But nothing must be done
6738  in a hurry.  I want it to be what _The Morning Post_ calls a suitable
6739  alliance, and I want you both to be happy."
6740  
6741  "What nonsense people talk about happy marriages!" exclaimed Lord
6742  Henry.  "A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love
6743  her."
6744  
6745  "Ah! what a cynic you are!" cried the old lady, pushing back her chair
6746  and nodding to Lady Ruxton.  "You must come and dine with me soon
6747  again.  You are really an admirable tonic, much better than what Sir
6748  Andrew prescribes for me.  You must tell me what people you would like
6749  to meet, though.  I want it to be a delightful gathering."
6750  
6751  "I like men who have a future and women who have a past," he answered.
6752  "Or do you think that would make it a petticoat party?"
6753  
6754  "I fear so," she said, laughing, as she stood up.  "A thousand pardons,
6755  my dear Lady Ruxton," she added, "I didn't see you hadn't finished your
6756  cigarette."
6757  
6758  "Never mind, Lady Narborough.  I smoke a great deal too much.  I am
6759  going to limit myself, for the future."
6760  
6761  "Pray don't, Lady Ruxton," said Lord Henry.  "Moderation is a fatal
6762  thing.  Enough is as bad as a meal.  More than enough is as good as a
6763  feast."
6764  
6765  Lady Ruxton glanced at him curiously.  "You must come and explain that
6766  to me some afternoon, Lord Henry.  It sounds a fascinating theory," she
6767  murmured, as she swept out of the room.
6768  
6769  "Now, mind you don't stay too long over your politics and scandal,"
6770  cried Lady Narborough from the door.  "If you do, we are sure to
6771  squabble upstairs."
6772  
6773  The men laughed, and Mr. Chapman got up solemnly from the foot of the
6774  table and came up to the top.  Dorian Gray changed his seat and went
6775  and sat by Lord Henry.  Mr. Chapman began to talk in a loud voice about
6776  the situation in the House of Commons.  He guffawed at his adversaries.
6777  The word _doctrinaire_--word full of terror to the British
6778  mind--reappeared from time to time between his explosions.  An
6779  alliterative prefix served as an ornament of oratory.  He hoisted the
6780  Union Jack on the pinnacles of thought.  The inherited stupidity of the
6781  race--sound English common sense he jovially termed it--was shown to be
6782  the proper bulwark for society.
6783  
6784  A smile curved Lord Henry's lips, and he turned round and looked at
6785  Dorian.
6786  
6787  "Are you better, my dear fellow?" he asked.  "You seemed rather out of
6788  sorts at dinner."
6789  
6790  "I am quite well, Harry.  I am tired.  That is all."
6791  
6792  "You were charming last night.  The little duchess is quite devoted to
6793  you.  She tells me she is going down to Selby."
6794  
6795  "She has promised to come on the twentieth."
6796  
6797  "Is Monmouth to be there, too?"
6798  
6799  "Oh, yes, Harry."
6800  
6801  "He bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he bores her.  She is very
6802  clever, too clever for a woman.  She lacks the indefinable charm of
6803  weakness.  It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image
6804  precious.  Her feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of clay.
6805  White porcelain feet, if you like.  They have been through the fire,
6806  and what fire does not destroy, it hardens.  She has had experiences."
6807  
6808  "How long has she been married?" asked Dorian.
6809  
6810  "An eternity, she tells me.  I believe, according to the peerage, it is
6811  ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity,
6812  with time thrown in.  Who else is coming?"
6813  
6814  "Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey
6815  Clouston, the usual set.  I have asked Lord Grotrian."
6816  
6817  "I like him," said Lord Henry.  "A great many people don't, but I find
6818  him charming.  He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by
6819  being always absolutely over-educated. He is a very modern type."
6820  
6821  "I don't know if he will be able to come, Harry.  He may have to go to
6822  Monte Carlo with his father."
6823  
6824  "Ah! what a nuisance people's people are!  Try and make him come.  By
6825  the way, Dorian, you ran off very early last night.  You left before
6826  eleven.  What did you do afterwards?  Did you go straight home?"
6827  
6828  Dorian glanced at him hurriedly and frowned.
6829  
6830  "No, Harry," he said at last, "I did not get home till nearly three."
6831  
6832  "Did you go to the club?"
6833  
6834  "Yes," he answered.  Then he bit his lip.  "No, I don't mean that.  I
6835  didn't go to the club.  I walked about.  I forget what I did.... How
6836  inquisitive you are, Harry!  You always want to know what one has been
6837  doing.  I always want to forget what I have been doing.  I came in at
6838  half-past two, if you wish to know the exact time.  I had left my
6839  latch-key at home, and my servant had to let me in.  If you want any
6840  corroborative evidence on the subject, you can ask him."
6841  
6842  Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.  "My dear fellow, as if I cared!
6843  Let us go up to the drawing-room. No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman.
6844  Something has happened to you, Dorian.  Tell me what it is.  You are
6845  not yourself to-night."
6846  
6847  "Don't mind me, Harry.  I am irritable, and out of temper.  I shall
6848  come round and see you to-morrow, or next day.  Make my excuses to Lady
6849  Narborough.  I shan't go upstairs.  I shall go home.  I must go home."
6850  
6851  "All right, Dorian.  I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at tea-time.
6852  The duchess is coming."
6853  
6854  "I will try to be there, Harry," he said, leaving the room.  As he
6855  drove back to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of terror
6856  he thought he had strangled had come back to him.  Lord Henry's casual
6857  questioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment, and he wanted
6858  his nerve still.  Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed.  He
6859  winced.  He hated the idea of even touching them.
6860  
6861  Yet it had to be done.  He realized that, and when he had locked the
6862  door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he had
6863  thrust Basil Hallward's coat and bag.  A huge fire was blazing.  He
6864  piled another log on it.  The smell of the singeing clothes and burning
6865  leather was horrible.  It took him three-quarters of an hour to consume
6866  everything.  At the end he felt faint and sick, and having lit some
6867  Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he bathed his hands and
6868  forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.
6869  
6870  Suddenly he started.  His eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed
6871  nervously at his underlip.  Between two of the windows stood a large
6872  Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue
6873  lapis.  He watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate
6874  and make afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet
6875  almost loathed.  His breath quickened.  A mad craving came over him.
6876  He lit a cigarette and then threw it away.  His eyelids drooped till
6877  the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek.  But he still watched
6878  the cabinet.  At last he got up from the sofa on which he had been
6879  lying, went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden
6880  spring.  A triangular drawer passed slowly out.  His fingers moved
6881  instinctively towards it, dipped in, and closed on something.  It was a
6882  small Chinese box of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought,
6883  the sides patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with
6884  round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads.  He opened it.
6885  Inside was a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and
6886  persistent.
6887  
6888  He hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his
6889  face.  Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly
6890  hot, he drew himself up and glanced at the clock.  It was twenty
6891  minutes to twelve.  He put the box back, shutting the cabinet doors as
6892  he did so, and went into his bedroom.
6893  
6894  As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray,
6895  dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept
6896  quietly out of his house.  In Bond Street he found a hansom with a good
6897  horse.  He hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address.
6898  
6899  The man shook his head.  "It is too far for me," he muttered.
6900  
6901  "Here is a sovereign for you," said Dorian.  "You shall have another if
6902  you drive fast."
6903  
6904  "All right, sir," answered the man, "you will be there in an hour," and
6905  after his fare had got in he turned his horse round and drove rapidly
6906  towards the river.
6907  
6908  
6909  
6910  CHAPTER 16
6911  
6912  A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly
6913  in the dripping mist.  The public-houses were just closing, and dim men
6914  and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors.  From
6915  some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter.  In others,
6916  drunkards brawled and screamed.
6917  
6918  Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian
6919  Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and
6920  now and then he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said
6921  to him on the first day they had met, "To cure the soul by means of the
6922  senses, and the senses by means of the soul."  Yes, that was the
6923  secret.  He had often tried it, and would try it again now.  There were
6924  opium dens where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the
6925  memory of old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were
6926  new.
6927  
6928  The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull.  From time to time a
6929  huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it.  The
6930  gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy.  Once the
6931  man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile.  A steam rose from
6932  the horse as it splashed up the puddles.  The sidewindows of the hansom
6933  were clogged with a grey-flannel mist.
6934  
6935  "To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of
6936  the soul!"  How the words rang in his ears!  His soul, certainly, was
6937  sick to death.  Was it true that the senses could cure it?  Innocent
6938  blood had been spilled.  What could atone for that?  Ah! for that there
6939  was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness
6940  was possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing
6941  out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one.
6942  Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him as he had done?  Who
6943  had made him a judge over others?  He had said things that were
6944  dreadful, horrible, not to be endured.
6945  
6946  On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each
6947  step.  He thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster.
6948  The hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him.  His throat burned
6949  and his delicate hands twitched nervously together.  He struck at the
6950  horse madly with his stick.  The driver laughed and whipped up.  He
6951  laughed in answer, and the man was silent.
6952  
6953  The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some
6954  sprawling spider.  The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist
6955  thickened, he felt afraid.
6956  
6957  Then they passed by lonely brickfields.  The fog was lighter here, and
6958  he could see the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange,
6959  fanlike tongues of fire.  A dog barked as they went by, and far away in
6960  the darkness some wandering sea-gull screamed.  The horse stumbled in a
6961  rut, then swerved aside and broke into a gallop.
6962  
6963  After some time they left the clay road and rattled again over
6964  rough-paven streets.  Most of the windows were dark, but now and then
6965  fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind.  He
6966  watched them curiously.  They moved like monstrous marionettes and made
6967  gestures like live things.  He hated them.  A dull rage was in his
6968  heart.  As they turned a corner, a woman yelled something at them from
6969  an open door, and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred
6970  yards.  The driver beat at them with his whip.
6971  
6972  It is said that passion makes one think in a circle.  Certainly with
6973  hideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped
6974  those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he had found in
6975  them the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and justified, by
6976  intellectual approval, passions that without such justification would
6977  still have dominated his temper.  From cell to cell of his brain crept
6978  the one thought; and the wild desire to live, most terrible of all
6979  man's appetites, quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre.
6980  Ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made things real,
6981  became dear to him now for that very reason.  Ugliness was the one
6982  reality.  The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of
6983  disordered life, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were more
6984  vivid, in their intense actuality of impression, than all the gracious
6985  shapes of art, the dreamy shadows of song.  They were what he needed
6986  for forgetfulness.  In three days he would be free.
6987  
6988  Suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane.  Over
6989  the low roofs and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the black
6990  masts of ships.  Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the
6991  yards.
6992  
6993  "Somewhere about here, sir, ain't it?" he asked huskily through the
6994  trap.
6995  
6996  Dorian started and peered round.  "This will do," he answered, and
6997  having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had
6998  promised him, he walked quickly in the direction of the quay.  Here and
6999  there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman.  The
7000  light shook and splintered in the puddles.  A red glare came from an
7001  outward-bound steamer that was coaling.  The slimy pavement looked like
7002  a wet mackintosh.
7003  
7004  He hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if he
7005  was being followed.  In about seven or eight minutes he reached a small
7006  shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories.  In one of
7007  the top-windows stood a lamp.  He stopped and gave a peculiar knock.
7008  
7009  After a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being
7010  unhooked.  The door opened quietly, and he went in without saying a
7011  word to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the
7012  shadow as he passed.  At the end of the hall hung a tattered green
7013  curtain that swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him
7014  in from the street.  He dragged it aside and entered a long low room
7015  which looked as if it had once been a third-rate dancing-saloon. Shrill
7016  flaring gas-jets, dulled and distorted in the fly-blown mirrors that
7017  faced them, were ranged round the walls.  Greasy reflectors of ribbed
7018  tin backed them, making quivering disks of light.  The floor was
7019  covered with ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud,
7020  and stained with dark rings of spilled liquor.  Some Malays were
7021  crouching by a little charcoal stove, playing with bone counters and
7022  showing their white teeth as they chattered.  In one corner, with his
7023  head buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled over a table, and by the
7024  tawdrily painted bar that ran across one complete side stood two
7025  haggard women, mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his
7026  coat with an expression of disgust.  "He thinks he's got red ants on
7027  him," laughed one of them, as Dorian passed by.  The man looked at her
7028  in terror and began to whimper.
7029  
7030  At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a
7031  darkened chamber.  As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the
7032  heavy odour of opium met him.  He heaved a deep breath, and his
7033  nostrils quivered with pleasure.  When he entered, a young man with
7034  smooth yellow hair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin
7035  pipe, looked up at him and nodded in a hesitating manner.
7036  
7037  "You here, Adrian?" muttered Dorian.
7038  
7039  "Where else should I be?" he answered, listlessly.  "None of the chaps
7040  will speak to me now."
7041  
7042  "I thought you had left England."
7043  
7044  "Darlington is not going to do anything.  My brother paid the bill at
7045  last.  George doesn't speak to me either.... I don't care," he added
7046  with a sigh.  "As long as one has this stuff, one doesn't want friends.
7047  I think I have had too many friends."
7048  
7049  Dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such
7050  fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses.  The twisted limbs, the
7051  gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him.  He knew in
7052  what strange heavens they were suffering, and what dull hells were
7053  teaching them the secret of some new joy.  They were better off than he
7054  was.  He was prisoned in thought.  Memory, like a horrible malady, was
7055  eating his soul away.  From time to time he seemed to see the eyes of
7056  Basil Hallward looking at him.  Yet he felt he could not stay.  The
7057  presence of Adrian Singleton troubled him.  He wanted to be where no
7058  one would know who he was.  He wanted to escape from himself.
7059  
7060  "I am going on to the other place," he said after a pause.
7061  
7062  "On the wharf?"
7063  
7064  "Yes."
7065  
7066  "That mad-cat is sure to be there.  They won't have her in this place
7067  now."
7068  
7069  Dorian shrugged his shoulders.  "I am sick of women who love one.
7070  Women who hate one are much more interesting.  Besides, the stuff is
7071  better."
7072  
7073  "Much the same."
7074  
7075  "I like it better.  Come and have something to drink.  I must have
7076  something."
7077  
7078  "I don't want anything," murmured the young man.
7079  
7080  "Never mind."
7081  
7082  Adrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar.  A
7083  half-caste, in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a hideous
7084  greeting as he thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers in front of
7085  them.  The women sidled up and began to chatter.  Dorian turned his
7086  back on them and said something in a low voice to Adrian Singleton.
7087  
7088  A crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of one of
7089  the women.  "We are very proud to-night," she sneered.
7090  
7091  "For God's sake don't talk to me," cried Dorian, stamping his foot on
7092  the ground.  "What do you want?  Money?  Here it is.  Don't ever talk
7093  to me again."
7094  
7095  Two red sparks flashed for a moment in the woman's sodden eyes, then
7096  flickered out and left them dull and glazed.  She tossed her head and
7097  raked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers.  Her companion
7098  watched her enviously.
7099  
7100  "It's no use," sighed Adrian Singleton.  "I don't care to go back.
7101  What does it matter?  I am quite happy here."
7102  
7103  "You will write to me if you want anything, won't you?" said Dorian,
7104  after a pause.
7105  
7106  "Perhaps."
7107  
7108  "Good night, then."
7109  
7110  "Good night," answered the young man, passing up the steps and wiping
7111  his parched mouth with a handkerchief.
7112  
7113  Dorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his face.  As he drew
7114  the curtain aside, a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips of the
7115  woman who had taken his money.  "There goes the devil's bargain!" she
7116  hiccoughed, in a hoarse voice.
7117  
7118  "Curse you!" he answered, "don't call me that."
7119  
7120  She snapped her fingers.  "Prince Charming is what you like to be
7121  called, ain't it?" she yelled after him.
7122  
7123  The drowsy sailor leaped to his feet as she spoke, and looked wildly
7124  round.  The sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on his ear.  He
7125  rushed out as if in pursuit.
7126  
7127  Dorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain.  His
7128  meeting with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him, and he wondered
7129  if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door, as
7130  Basil Hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult.  He bit his
7131  lip, and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad.  Yet, after all, what did
7132  it matter to him?  One's days were too brief to take the burden of
7133  another's errors on one's shoulders.  Each man lived his own life and
7134  paid his own price for living it.  The only pity was one had to pay so
7135  often for a single fault.  One had to pay over and over again, indeed.
7136  In her dealings with man, destiny never closed her accounts.
7137  
7138  There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or
7139  for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature that every fibre of
7140  the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful
7141  impulses.  Men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their
7142  will.  They move to their terrible end as automatons move.  Choice is
7143  taken from them, and conscience is either killed, or, if it lives at
7144  all, lives but to give rebellion its fascination and disobedience its
7145  charm.  For all sins, as theologians weary not of reminding us, are
7146  sins of disobedience.  When that high spirit, that morning star of
7147  evil, fell from heaven, it was as a rebel that he fell.
7148  
7149  Callous, concentrated on evil, with stained mind, and soul hungry for
7150  rebellion, Dorian Gray hastened on, quickening his step as he went, but
7151  as he darted aside into a dim archway, that had served him often as a
7152  short cut to the ill-famed place where he was going, he felt himself
7153  suddenly seized from behind, and before he had time to defend himself,
7154  he was thrust back against the wall, with a brutal hand round his
7155  throat.
7156  
7157  He struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched the
7158  tightening fingers away.  In a second he heard the click of a revolver,
7159  and saw the gleam of a polished barrel, pointing straight at his head,
7160  and the dusky form of a short, thick-set man facing him.
7161  
7162  "What do you want?" he gasped.
7163  
7164  "Keep quiet," said the man.  "If you stir, I shoot you."
7165  
7166  "You are mad.  What have I done to you?"
7167  
7168  "You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane," was the answer, "and Sibyl Vane
7169  was my sister.  She killed herself.  I know it.  Her death is at your
7170  door.  I swore I would kill you in return.  For years I have sought
7171  you.  I had no clue, no trace.  The two people who could have described
7172  you were dead.  I knew nothing of you but the pet name she used to call
7173  you.  I heard it to-night by chance.  Make your peace with God, for
7174  to-night you are going to die."
7175  
7176  Dorian Gray grew sick with fear.  "I never knew her," he stammered.  "I
7177  never heard of her.  You are mad."
7178  
7179  "You had better confess your sin, for as sure as I am James Vane, you
7180  are going to die."  There was a horrible moment.  Dorian did not know
7181  what to say or do.  "Down on your knees!" growled the man.  "I give you
7182  one minute to make your peace--no more.  I go on board to-night for
7183  India, and I must do my job first.  One minute.  That's all."
7184  
7185  Dorian's arms fell to his side.  Paralysed with terror, he did not know
7186  what to do.  Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his brain.  "Stop," he
7187  cried.  "How long ago is it since your sister died?  Quick, tell me!"
7188  
7189  "Eighteen years," said the man.  "Why do you ask me?  What do years
7190  matter?"
7191  
7192  "Eighteen years," laughed Dorian Gray, with a touch of triumph in his
7193  voice.  "Eighteen years!  Set me under the lamp and look at my face!"
7194  
7195  James Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what was meant.
7196  Then he seized Dorian Gray and dragged him from the archway.
7197  
7198  Dim and wavering as was the wind-blown light, yet it served to show him
7199  the hideous error, as it seemed, into which he had fallen, for the face
7200  of the man he had sought to kill had all the bloom of boyhood, all the
7201  unstained purity of youth.  He seemed little more than a lad of twenty
7202  summers, hardly older, if older indeed at all, than his sister had been
7203  when they had parted so many years ago.  It was obvious that this was
7204  not the man who had destroyed her life.
7205  
7206  He loosened his hold and reeled back.  "My God! my God!" he cried, "and
7207  I would have murdered you!"
7208  
7209  Dorian Gray drew a long breath.  "You have been on the brink of
7210  committing a terrible crime, my man," he said, looking at him sternly.
7211  "Let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own
7212  hands."
7213  
7214  "Forgive me, sir," muttered James Vane.  "I was deceived.  A chance
7215  word I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track."
7216  
7217  "You had better go home and put that pistol away, or you may get into
7218  trouble," said Dorian, turning on his heel and going slowly down the
7219  street.
7220  
7221  James Vane stood on the pavement in horror.  He was trembling from head
7222  to foot.  After a little while, a black shadow that had been creeping
7223  along the dripping wall moved out into the light and came close to him
7224  with stealthy footsteps.  He felt a hand laid on his arm and looked
7225  round with a start.  It was one of the women who had been drinking at
7226  the bar.
7227  
7228  "Why didn't you kill him?" she hissed out, putting haggard face quite
7229  close to his.  "I knew you were following him when you rushed out from
7230  Daly's. You fool!  You should have killed him.  He has lots of money,
7231  and he's as bad as bad."
7232  
7233  "He is not the man I am looking for," he answered, "and I want no man's
7234  money.  I want a man's life.  The man whose life I want must be nearly
7235  forty now.  This one is little more than a boy.  Thank God, I have not
7236  got his blood upon my hands."
7237  
7238  The woman gave a bitter laugh.  "Little more than a boy!" she sneered.
7239  "Why, man, it's nigh on eighteen years since Prince Charming made me
7240  what I am."
7241  
7242  "You lie!" cried James Vane.
7243  
7244  She raised her hand up to heaven.  "Before God I am telling the truth,"
7245  she cried.
7246  
7247  "Before God?"
7248  
7249  "Strike me dumb if it ain't so.  He is the worst one that comes here.
7250  They say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face.  It's nigh
7251  on eighteen years since I met him.  He hasn't changed much since then.
7252  I have, though," she added, with a sickly leer.
7253  
7254  "You swear this?"
7255  
7256  "I swear it," came in hoarse echo from her flat mouth.  "But don't give
7257  me away to him," she whined; "I am afraid of him.  Let me have some
7258  money for my night's lodging."
7259  
7260  He broke from her with an oath and rushed to the corner of the street,
7261  but Dorian Gray had disappeared.  When he looked back, the woman had
7262  vanished also.
7263  
7264  
7265  
7266  CHAPTER 17
7267  
7268  A week later Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at Selby
7269  Royal, talking to the pretty Duchess of Monmouth, who with her husband,
7270  a jaded-looking man of sixty, was amongst his guests.  It was tea-time,
7271  and the mellow light of the huge, lace-covered lamp that stood on the
7272  table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at
7273  which the duchess was presiding.  Her white hands were moving daintily
7274  among the cups, and her full red lips were smiling at something that
7275  Dorian had whispered to her.  Lord Henry was lying back in a
7276  silk-draped wicker chair, looking at them.  On a peach-coloured divan
7277  sat Lady Narborough, pretending to listen to the duke's description of
7278  the last Brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection.  Three
7279  young men in elaborate smoking-suits were handing tea-cakes to some of
7280  the women.  The house-party consisted of twelve people, and there were
7281  more expected to arrive on the next day.
7282  
7283  "What are you two talking about?" said Lord Henry, strolling over to
7284  the table and putting his cup down.  "I hope Dorian has told you about
7285  my plan for rechristening everything, Gladys.  It is a delightful idea."
7286  
7287  "But I don't want to be rechristened, Harry," rejoined the duchess,
7288  looking up at him with her wonderful eyes.  "I am quite satisfied with
7289  my own name, and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied with his."
7290  
7291  "My dear Gladys, I would not alter either name for the world.  They are
7292  both perfect.  I was thinking chiefly of flowers.  Yesterday I cut an
7293  orchid, for my button-hole. It was a marvellous spotted thing, as
7294  effective as the seven deadly sins.  In a thoughtless moment I asked
7295  one of the gardeners what it was called.  He told me it was a fine
7296  specimen of _Robinsoniana_, or something dreadful of that kind.  It is a
7297  sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to
7298  things.  Names are everything.  I never quarrel with actions.  My one
7299  quarrel is with words.  That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in
7300  literature.  The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled
7301  to use one.  It is the only thing he is fit for."
7302  
7303  "Then what should we call you, Harry?" she asked.
7304  
7305  "His name is Prince Paradox," said Dorian.
7306  
7307  "I recognize him in a flash," exclaimed the duchess.
7308  
7309  "I won't hear of it," laughed Lord Henry, sinking into a chair.  "From
7310  a label there is no escape!  I refuse the title."
7311  
7312  "Royalties may not abdicate," fell as a warning from pretty lips.
7313  
7314  "You wish me to defend my throne, then?"
7315  
7316  "Yes."
7317  
7318  "I give the truths of to-morrow."
7319  
7320  "I prefer the mistakes of to-day," she answered.
7321  
7322  "You disarm me, Gladys," he cried, catching the wilfulness of her mood.
7323  
7324  "Of your shield, Harry, not of your spear."
7325  
7326  "I never tilt against beauty," he said, with a wave of his hand.
7327  
7328  "That is your error, Harry, believe me.  You value beauty far too much."
7329  
7330  "How can you say that?  I admit that I think that it is better to be
7331  beautiful than to be good.  But on the other hand, no one is more ready
7332  than I am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly."
7333  
7334  "Ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins, then?" cried the duchess.
7335  "What becomes of your simile about the orchid?"
7336  
7337  "Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, Gladys.  You, as a good
7338  Tory, must not underrate them.  Beer, the Bible, and the seven deadly
7339  virtues have made our England what she is."
7340  
7341  "You don't like your country, then?" she asked.
7342  
7343  "I live in it."
7344  
7345  "That you may censure it the better."
7346  
7347  "Would you have me take the verdict of Europe on it?" he inquired.
7348  
7349  "What do they say of us?"
7350  
7351  "That Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop."
7352  
7353  "Is that yours, Harry?"
7354  
7355  "I give it to you."
7356  
7357  "I could not use it.  It is too true."
7358  
7359  "You need not be afraid.  Our countrymen never recognize a description."
7360  
7361  "They are practical."
7362  
7363  "They are more cunning than practical.  When they make up their ledger,
7364  they balance stupidity by wealth, and vice by hypocrisy."
7365  
7366  "Still, we have done great things."
7367  
7368  "Great things have been thrust on us, Gladys."
7369  
7370  "We have carried their burden."
7371  
7372  "Only as far as the Stock Exchange."
7373  
7374  She shook her head.  "I believe in the race," she cried.
7375  
7376  "It represents the survival of the pushing."
7377  
7378  "It has development."
7379  
7380  "Decay fascinates me more."
7381  
7382  "What of art?" she asked.
7383  
7384  "It is a malady."
7385  
7386  "Love?"
7387  
7388  "An illusion."
7389  
7390  "Religion?"
7391  
7392  "The fashionable substitute for belief."
7393  
7394  "You are a sceptic."
7395  
7396  "Never!  Scepticism is the beginning of faith."
7397  
7398  "What are you?"
7399  
7400  "To define is to limit."
7401  
7402  "Give me a clue."
7403  
7404  "Threads snap.  You would lose your way in the labyrinth."
7405  
7406  "You bewilder me.  Let us talk of some one else."
7407  
7408  "Our host is a delightful topic.  Years ago he was christened Prince
7409  Charming."
7410  
7411  "Ah! don't remind me of that," cried Dorian Gray.
7412  
7413  "Our host is rather horrid this evening," answered the duchess,
7414  colouring.  "I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely
7415  scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern
7416  butterfly."
7417  
7418  "Well, I hope he won't stick pins into you, Duchess," laughed Dorian.
7419  
7420  "Oh! my maid does that already, Mr. Gray, when she is annoyed with me."
7421  
7422  "And what does she get annoyed with you about, Duchess?"
7423  
7424  "For the most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you.  Usually because
7425  I come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be dressed by
7426  half-past eight."
7427  
7428  "How unreasonable of her!  You should give her warning."
7429  
7430  "I daren't, Mr. Gray.  Why, she invents hats for me.  You remember the
7431  one I wore at Lady Hilstone's garden-party?  You don't, but it is nice
7432  of you to pretend that you do.  Well, she made it out of nothing.  All
7433  good hats are made out of nothing."
7434  
7435  "Like all good reputations, Gladys," interrupted Lord Henry.  "Every
7436  effect that one produces gives one an enemy.  To be popular one must be
7437  a mediocrity."
7438  
7439  "Not with women," said the duchess, shaking her head; "and women rule
7440  the world.  I assure you we can't bear mediocrities.  We women, as some
7441  one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if
7442  you ever love at all."
7443  
7444  "It seems to me that we never do anything else," murmured Dorian.
7445  
7446  "Ah! then, you never really love, Mr. Gray," answered the duchess with
7447  mock sadness.
7448  
7449  "My dear Gladys!" cried Lord Henry.  "How can you say that?  Romance
7450  lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art.
7451  Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved.
7452  Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion.  It merely
7453  intensifies it.  We can have in life but one great experience at best,
7454  and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as
7455  possible."
7456  
7457  "Even when one has been wounded by it, Harry?" asked the duchess after
7458  a pause.
7459  
7460  "Especially when one has been wounded by it," answered Lord Henry.
7461  
7462  The duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious expression
7463  in her eyes.  "What do you say to that, Mr. Gray?" she inquired.
7464  
7465  Dorian hesitated for a moment.  Then he threw his head back and
7466  laughed.  "I always agree with Harry, Duchess."
7467  
7468  "Even when he is wrong?"
7469  
7470  "Harry is never wrong, Duchess."
7471  
7472  "And does his philosophy make you happy?"
7473  
7474  "I have never searched for happiness.  Who wants happiness?  I have
7475  searched for pleasure."
7476  
7477  "And found it, Mr. Gray?"
7478  
7479  "Often.  Too often."
7480  
7481  The duchess sighed.  "I am searching for peace," she said, "and if I
7482  don't go and dress, I shall have none this evening."
7483  
7484  "Let me get you some orchids, Duchess," cried Dorian, starting to his
7485  feet and walking down the conservatory.
7486  
7487  "You are flirting disgracefully with him," said Lord Henry to his
7488  cousin.  "You had better take care.  He is very fascinating."
7489  
7490  "If he were not, there would be no battle."
7491  
7492  "Greek meets Greek, then?"
7493  
7494  "I am on the side of the Trojans.  They fought for a woman."
7495  
7496  "They were defeated."
7497  
7498  "There are worse things than capture," she answered.
7499  
7500  "You gallop with a loose rein."
7501  
7502  "Pace gives life," was the _riposte_.
7503  
7504  "I shall write it in my diary to-night."
7505  
7506  "What?"
7507  
7508  "That a burnt child loves the fire."
7509  
7510  "I am not even singed.  My wings are untouched."
7511  
7512  "You use them for everything, except flight."
7513  
7514  "Courage has passed from men to women.  It is a new experience for us."
7515  
7516  "You have a rival."
7517  
7518  "Who?"
7519  
7520  He laughed.  "Lady Narborough," he whispered.  "She perfectly adores
7521  him."
7522  
7523  "You fill me with apprehension.  The appeal to antiquity is fatal to us
7524  who are romanticists."
7525  
7526  "Romanticists!  You have all the methods of science."
7527  
7528  "Men have educated us."
7529  
7530  "But not explained you."
7531  
7532  "Describe us as a sex," was her challenge.
7533  
7534  "Sphinxes without secrets."
7535  
7536  She looked at him, smiling.  "How long Mr. Gray is!" she said.  "Let us
7537  go and help him.  I have not yet told him the colour of my frock."
7538  
7539  "Ah! you must suit your frock to his flowers, Gladys."
7540  
7541  "That would be a premature surrender."
7542  
7543  "Romantic art begins with its climax."
7544  
7545  "I must keep an opportunity for retreat."
7546  
7547  "In the Parthian manner?"
7548  
7549  "They found safety in the desert.  I could not do that."
7550  
7551  "Women are not always allowed a choice," he answered, but hardly had he
7552  finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came
7553  a stifled groan, followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall.  Everybody
7554  started up.  The duchess stood motionless in horror.  And with fear in
7555  his eyes, Lord Henry rushed through the flapping palms to find Dorian
7556  Gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon.
7557  
7558  He was carried at once into the blue drawing-room and laid upon one of
7559  the sofas.  After a short time, he came to himself and looked round
7560  with a dazed expression.
7561  
7562  "What has happened?" he asked.  "Oh!  I remember.  Am I safe here,
7563  Harry?" He began to tremble.
7564  
7565  "My dear Dorian," answered Lord Henry, "you merely fainted.  That was
7566  all.  You must have overtired yourself.  You had better not come down
7567  to dinner.  I will take your place."
7568  
7569  "No, I will come down," he said, struggling to his feet.  "I would
7570  rather come down.  I must not be alone."
7571  
7572  He went to his room and dressed.  There was a wild recklessness of
7573  gaiety in his manner as he sat at table, but now and then a thrill of
7574  terror ran through him when he remembered that, pressed against the
7575  window of the conservatory, like a white handkerchief, he had seen the
7576  face of James Vane watching him.
7577  
7578  
7579  
7580  CHAPTER 18
7581  
7582  The next day he did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most of the
7583  time in his own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and yet
7584  indifferent to life itself.  The consciousness of being hunted, snared,
7585  tracked down, had begun to dominate him.  If the tapestry did but
7586  tremble in the wind, he shook.  The dead leaves that were blown against
7587  the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild
7588  regrets.  When he closed his eyes, he saw again the sailor's face
7589  peering through the mist-stained glass, and horror seemed once more to
7590  lay its hand upon his heart.
7591  
7592  But perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of
7593  the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him.  Actual
7594  life was chaos, but there was something terribly logical in the
7595  imagination.  It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet
7596  of sin.  It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen
7597  brood.  In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor
7598  the good rewarded.  Success was given to the strong, failure thrust
7599  upon the weak.  That was all.  Besides, had any stranger been prowling
7600  round the house, he would have been seen by the servants or the
7601  keepers.  Had any foot-marks been found on the flower-beds, the
7602  gardeners would have reported it.  Yes, it had been merely fancy.
7603  Sibyl Vane's brother had not come back to kill him.  He had sailed away
7604  in his ship to founder in some winter sea.  From him, at any rate, he
7605  was safe.  Why, the man did not know who he was, could not know who he
7606  was.  The mask of youth had saved him.
7607  
7608  And yet if it had been merely an illusion, how terrible it was to think
7609  that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms, and give them
7610  visible form, and make them move before one!  What sort of life would
7611  his be if, day and night, shadows of his crime were to peer at him from
7612  silent corners, to mock him from secret places, to whisper in his ear
7613  as he sat at the feast, to wake him with icy fingers as he lay asleep!
7614  As the thought crept through his brain, he grew pale with terror, and
7615  the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder.  Oh! in what a
7616  wild hour of madness he had killed his friend!  How ghastly the mere
7617  memory of the scene!  He saw it all again.  Each hideous detail came
7618  back to him with added horror.  Out of the black cave of time, terrible
7619  and swathed in scarlet, rose the image of his sin.  When Lord Henry
7620  came in at six o'clock, he found him crying as one whose heart will
7621  break.
7622  
7623  It was not till the third day that he ventured to go out.  There was
7624  something in the clear, pine-scented air of that winter morning that
7625  seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life.  But
7626  it was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had
7627  caused the change.  His own nature had revolted against the excess of
7628  anguish that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm.
7629  With subtle and finely wrought temperaments it is always so.  Their
7630  strong passions must either bruise or bend.  They either slay the man,
7631  or themselves die.  Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.  The
7632  loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude.
7633  Besides, he had convinced himself that he had been the victim of a
7634  terror-stricken imagination, and looked back now on his fears with
7635  something of pity and not a little of contempt.
7636  
7637  After breakfast, he walked with the duchess for an hour in the garden
7638  and then drove across the park to join the shooting-party. The crisp
7639  frost lay like salt upon the grass.  The sky was an inverted cup of
7640  blue metal.  A thin film of ice bordered the flat, reed-grown lake.
7641  
7642  At the corner of the pine-wood he caught sight of Sir Geoffrey
7643  Clouston, the duchess's brother, jerking two spent cartridges out of
7644  his gun.  He jumped from the cart, and having told the groom to take
7645  the mare home, made his way towards his guest through the withered
7646  bracken and rough undergrowth.
7647  
7648  "Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?" he asked.
7649  
7650  "Not very good, Dorian.  I think most of the birds have gone to the
7651  open.  I dare say it will be better after lunch, when we get to new
7652  ground."
7653  
7654  Dorian strolled along by his side.  The keen aromatic air, the brown
7655  and red lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of the
7656  beaters ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns
7657  that followed, fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful
7658  freedom.  He was dominated by the carelessness of happiness, by the
7659  high indifference of joy.
7660  
7661  Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front
7662  of them, with black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it
7663  forward, started a hare.  It bolted for a thicket of alders.  Sir
7664  Geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder, but there was something in the
7665  animal's grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray, and he
7666  cried out at once, "Don't shoot it, Geoffrey.  Let it live."
7667  
7668  "What nonsense, Dorian!" laughed his companion, and as the hare bounded
7669  into the thicket, he fired.  There were two cries heard, the cry of a
7670  hare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which is
7671  worse.
7672  
7673  "Good heavens!  I have hit a beater!" exclaimed Sir Geoffrey.  "What an
7674  ass the man was to get in front of the guns!  Stop shooting there!" he
7675  called out at the top of his voice.  "A man is hurt."
7676  
7677  The head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand.
7678  
7679  "Where, sir?  Where is he?" he shouted.  At the same time, the firing
7680  ceased along the line.
7681  
7682  "Here," answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the thicket.
7683  "Why on earth don't you keep your men back?  Spoiled my shooting for
7684  the day."
7685  
7686  Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the
7687  lithe swinging branches aside.  In a few moments they emerged, dragging
7688  a body after them into the sunlight.  He turned away in horror.  It
7689  seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went.  He heard Sir
7690  Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative answer of
7691  the keeper.  The wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with
7692  faces.  There was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of
7693  voices.  A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the
7694  boughs overhead.
7695  
7696  After a few moments--that were to him, in his perturbed state, like
7697  endless hours of pain--he felt a hand laid on his shoulder.  He started
7698  and looked round.
7699  
7700  "Dorian," said Lord Henry, "I had better tell them that the shooting is
7701  stopped for to-day. It would not look well to go on."
7702  
7703  "I wish it were stopped for ever, Harry," he answered bitterly.  "The
7704  whole thing is hideous and cruel.  Is the man ...?"
7705  
7706  He could not finish the sentence.
7707  
7708  "I am afraid so," rejoined Lord Henry.  "He got the whole charge of
7709  shot in his chest.  He must have died almost instantaneously.  Come;
7710  let us go home."
7711  
7712  They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly
7713  fifty yards without speaking.  Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and
7714  said, with a heavy sigh, "It is a bad omen, Harry, a very bad omen."
7715  
7716  "What is?" asked Lord Henry.  "Oh! this accident, I suppose.  My dear
7717  fellow, it can't be helped.  It was the man's own fault.  Why did he
7718  get in front of the guns?  Besides, it is nothing to us.  It is rather
7719  awkward for Geoffrey, of course.  It does not do to pepper beaters.  It
7720  makes people think that one is a wild shot.  And Geoffrey is not; he
7721  shoots very straight.  But there is no use talking about the matter."
7722  
7723  Dorian shook his head.  "It is a bad omen, Harry.  I feel as if
7724  something horrible were going to happen to some of us.  To myself,
7725  perhaps," he added, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture of
7726  pain.
7727  
7728  The elder man laughed.  "The only horrible thing in the world is _ennui_,
7729  Dorian.  That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness.  But we
7730  are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep chattering
7731  about this thing at dinner.  I must tell them that the subject is to be
7732  tabooed.  As for omens, there is no such thing as an omen.  Destiny
7733  does not send us heralds.  She is too wise or too cruel for that.
7734  Besides, what on earth could happen to you, Dorian?  You have
7735  everything in the world that a man can want.  There is no one who would
7736  not be delighted to change places with you."
7737  
7738  "There is no one with whom I would not change places, Harry.  Don't
7739  laugh like that.  I am telling you the truth.  The wretched peasant who
7740  has just died is better off than I am.  I have no terror of death.  It
7741  is the coming of death that terrifies me.  Its monstrous wings seem to
7742  wheel in the leaden air around me.  Good heavens! don't you see a man
7743  moving behind the trees there, watching me, waiting for me?"
7744  
7745  Lord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand
7746  was pointing.  "Yes," he said, smiling, "I see the gardener waiting for
7747  you.  I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on
7748  the table to-night. How absurdly nervous you are, my dear fellow!  You
7749  must come and see my doctor, when we get back to town."
7750  
7751  Dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching.  The
7752  man touched his hat, glanced for a moment at Lord Henry in a hesitating
7753  manner, and then produced a letter, which he handed to his master.
7754  "Her Grace told me to wait for an answer," he murmured.
7755  
7756  Dorian put the letter into his pocket.  "Tell her Grace that I am
7757  coming in," he said, coldly.  The man turned round and went rapidly in
7758  the direction of the house.
7759  
7760  "How fond women are of doing dangerous things!" laughed Lord Henry.
7761  "It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most.  A woman will
7762  flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on."
7763  
7764  "How fond you are of saying dangerous things, Harry!  In the present
7765  instance, you are quite astray.  I like the duchess very much, but I
7766  don't love her."
7767  
7768  "And the duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, so you
7769  are excellently matched."
7770  
7771  "You are talking scandal, Harry, and there is never any basis for
7772  scandal."
7773  
7774  "The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty," said Lord Henry,
7775  lighting a cigarette.
7776  
7777  "You would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an epigram."
7778  
7779  "The world goes to the altar of its own accord," was the answer.
7780  
7781  "I wish I could love," cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of pathos in
7782  his voice.  "But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the
7783  desire.  I am too much concentrated on myself.  My own personality has
7784  become a burden to me.  I want to escape, to go away, to forget.  It
7785  was silly of me to come down here at all.  I think I shall send a wire
7786  to Harvey to have the yacht got ready.  On a yacht one is safe."
7787  
7788  "Safe from what, Dorian?  You are in some trouble.  Why not tell me
7789  what it is?  You know I would help you."
7790  
7791  "I can't tell you, Harry," he answered sadly.  "And I dare say it is
7792  only a fancy of mine.  This unfortunate accident has upset me.  I have
7793  a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me."
7794  
7795  "What nonsense!"
7796  
7797  "I hope it is, but I can't help feeling it.  Ah! here is the duchess,
7798  looking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown.  You see we have come back,
7799  Duchess."
7800  
7801  "I have heard all about it, Mr. Gray," she answered.  "Poor Geoffrey is
7802  terribly upset.  And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare.
7803  How curious!"
7804  
7805  "Yes, it was very curious.  I don't know what made me say it.  Some
7806  whim, I suppose.  It looked the loveliest of little live things.  But I
7807  am sorry they told you about the man.  It is a hideous subject."
7808  
7809  "It is an annoying subject," broke in Lord Henry.  "It has no
7810  psychological value at all.  Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on
7811  purpose, how interesting he would be!  I should like to know some one
7812  who had committed a real murder."
7813  
7814  "How horrid of you, Harry!" cried the duchess.  "Isn't it, Mr. Gray?
7815  Harry, Mr. Gray is ill again.  He is going to faint."
7816  
7817  Dorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled.  "It is nothing,
7818  Duchess," he murmured; "my nerves are dreadfully out of order.  That is
7819  all.  I am afraid I walked too far this morning.  I didn't hear what
7820  Harry said.  Was it very bad?  You must tell me some other time.  I
7821  think I must go and lie down.  You will excuse me, won't you?"
7822  
7823  They had reached the great flight of steps that led from the
7824  conservatory on to the terrace.  As the glass door closed behind
7825  Dorian, Lord Henry turned and looked at the duchess with his slumberous
7826  eyes.  "Are you very much in love with him?" he asked.
7827  
7828  She did not answer for some time, but stood gazing at the landscape.
7829  "I wish I knew," she said at last.
7830  
7831  He shook his head.  "Knowledge would be fatal.  It is the uncertainty
7832  that charms one.  A mist makes things wonderful."
7833  
7834  "One may lose one's way."
7835  
7836  "All ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys."
7837  
7838  "What is that?"
7839  
7840  "Disillusion."
7841  
7842  "It was my _debut_ in life," she sighed.
7843  
7844  "It came to you crowned."
7845  
7846  "I am tired of strawberry leaves."
7847  
7848  "They become you."
7849  
7850  "Only in public."
7851  
7852  "You would miss them," said Lord Henry.
7853  
7854  "I will not part with a petal."
7855  
7856  "Monmouth has ears."
7857  
7858  "Old age is dull of hearing."
7859  
7860  "Has he never been jealous?"
7861  
7862  "I wish he had been."
7863  
7864  He glanced about as if in search of something.  "What are you looking
7865  for?" she inquired.
7866  
7867  "The button from your foil," he answered.  "You have dropped it."
7868  
7869  She laughed.  "I have still the mask."
7870  
7871  "It makes your eyes lovelier," was his reply.
7872  
7873  She laughed again.  Her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet
7874  fruit.
7875  
7876  Upstairs, in his own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with terror
7877  in every tingling fibre of his body.  Life had suddenly become too
7878  hideous a burden for him to bear.  The dreadful death of the unlucky
7879  beater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had seemed to him to
7880  pre-figure death for himself also.  He had nearly swooned at what Lord
7881  Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting.
7882  
7883  At five o'clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to
7884  pack his things for the night-express to town, and to have the brougham
7885  at the door by eight-thirty. He was determined not to sleep another
7886  night at Selby Royal.  It was an ill-omened place.  Death walked there
7887  in the sunlight.  The grass of the forest had been spotted with blood.
7888  
7889  Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him that he was going up to
7890  town to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain his guests in
7891  his absence.  As he was putting it into the envelope, a knock came to
7892  the door, and his valet informed him that the head-keeper wished to see
7893  him.  He frowned and bit his lip.  "Send him in," he muttered, after
7894  some moments' hesitation.
7895  
7896  As soon as the man entered, Dorian pulled his chequebook out of a
7897  drawer and spread it out before him.
7898  
7899  "I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this
7900  morning, Thornton?" he said, taking up a pen.
7901  
7902  "Yes, sir," answered the gamekeeper.
7903  
7904  "Was the poor fellow married?  Had he any people dependent on him?"
7905  asked Dorian, looking bored.  "If so, I should not like them to be left
7906  in want, and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary."
7907  
7908  "We don't know who he is, sir.  That is what I took the liberty of
7909  coming to you about."
7910  
7911  "Don't know who he is?" said Dorian, listlessly.  "What do you mean?
7912  Wasn't he one of your men?"
7913  
7914  "No, sir.  Never saw him before.  Seems like a sailor, sir."
7915  
7916  The pen dropped from Dorian Gray's hand, and he felt as if his heart
7917  had suddenly stopped beating.  "A sailor?" he cried out.  "Did you say
7918  a sailor?"
7919  
7920  "Yes, sir.  He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed on
7921  both arms, and that kind of thing."
7922  
7923  "Was there anything found on him?" said Dorian, leaning forward and
7924  looking at the man with startled eyes.  "Anything that would tell his
7925  name?"
7926  
7927  "Some money, sir--not much, and a six-shooter. There was no name of any
7928  kind.  A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like. A sort of sailor we
7929  think."
7930  
7931  Dorian started to his feet.  A terrible hope fluttered past him.  He
7932  clutched at it madly.  "Where is the body?" he exclaimed.  "Quick!  I
7933  must see it at once."
7934  
7935  "It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir.  The folk don't like
7936  to have that sort of thing in their houses.  They say a corpse brings
7937  bad luck."
7938  
7939  "The Home Farm!  Go there at once and meet me.  Tell one of the grooms
7940  to bring my horse round.  No. Never mind.  I'll go to the stables
7941  myself.  It will save time."
7942  
7943  In less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping down the
7944  long avenue as hard as he could go.  The trees seemed to sweep past him
7945  in spectral procession, and wild shadows to fling themselves across his
7946  path.  Once the mare swerved at a white gate-post and nearly threw him.
7947  He lashed her across the neck with his crop.  She cleft the dusky air
7948  like an arrow.  The stones flew from her hoofs.
7949  
7950  At last he reached the Home Farm.  Two men were loitering in the yard.
7951  He leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them.  In the
7952  farthest stable a light was glimmering.  Something seemed to tell him
7953  that the body was there, and he hurried to the door and put his hand
7954  upon the latch.
7955  
7956  There he paused for a moment, feeling that he was on the brink of a
7957  discovery that would either make or mar his life.  Then he thrust the
7958  door open and entered.
7959  
7960  On a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man
7961  dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers.  A spotted
7962  handkerchief had been placed over the face.  A coarse candle, stuck in
7963  a bottle, sputtered beside it.
7964  
7965  Dorian Gray shuddered.  He felt that his could not be the hand to take
7966  the handkerchief away, and called out to one of the farm-servants to
7967  come to him.
7968  
7969  "Take that thing off the face.  I wish to see it," he said, clutching
7970  at the door-post for support.
7971  
7972  When the farm-servant had done so, he stepped forward.  A cry of joy
7973  broke from his lips.  The man who had been shot in the thicket was
7974  James Vane.
7975  
7976  He stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body.  As he rode
7977  home, his eyes were full of tears, for he knew he was safe.
7978  
7979  
7980  
7981  CHAPTER 19
7982  
7983  "There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good," cried
7984  Lord Henry, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl filled
7985  with rose-water. "You are quite perfect.  Pray, don't change."
7986  
7987  Dorian Gray shook his head.  "No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful
7988  things in my life.  I am not going to do any more.  I began my good
7989  actions yesterday."
7990  
7991  "Where were you yesterday?"
7992  
7993  "In the country, Harry.  I was staying at a little inn by myself."
7994  
7995  "My dear boy," said Lord Henry, smiling, "anybody can be good in the
7996  country.  There are no temptations there.  That is the reason why
7997  people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized.
7998  Civilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to.  There are
7999  only two ways by which man can reach it.  One is by being cultured, the
8000  other by being corrupt.  Country people have no opportunity of being
8001  either, so they stagnate."
8002  
8003  "Culture and corruption," echoed Dorian.  "I have known something of
8004  both.  It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found
8005  together.  For I have a new ideal, Harry.  I am going to alter.  I
8006  think I have altered."
8007  
8008  "You have not yet told me what your good action was.  Or did you say
8009  you had done more than one?" asked his companion as he spilled into his
8010  plate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries and, through a
8011  perforated, shell-shaped spoon, snowed white sugar upon them.
8012  
8013  "I can tell you, Harry.  It is not a story I could tell to any one
8014  else.  I spared somebody.  It sounds vain, but you understand what I
8015  mean.  She was quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane.  I
8016  think it was that which first attracted me to her.  You remember Sibyl,
8017  don't you?  How long ago that seems!  Well, Hetty was not one of our
8018  own class, of course.  She was simply a girl in a village.  But I
8019  really loved her.  I am quite sure that I loved her.  All during this
8020  wonderful May that we have been having, I used to run down and see her
8021  two or three times a week.  Yesterday she met me in a little orchard.
8022  The apple-blossoms kept tumbling down on her hair, and she was
8023  laughing.  We were to have gone away together this morning at dawn.
8024  Suddenly I determined to leave her as flowerlike as I had found her."
8025  
8026  "I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill
8027  of real pleasure, Dorian," interrupted Lord Henry.  "But I can finish
8028  your idyll for you.  You gave her good advice and broke her heart.
8029  That was the beginning of your reformation."
8030  
8031  "Harry, you are horrible!  You mustn't say these dreadful things.
8032  Hetty's heart is not broken.  Of course, she cried and all that.  But
8033  there is no disgrace upon her.  She can live, like Perdita, in her
8034  garden of mint and marigold."
8035  
8036  "And weep over a faithless Florizel," said Lord Henry, laughing, as he
8037  leaned back in his chair.  "My dear Dorian, you have the most curiously
8038  boyish moods.  Do you think this girl will ever be really content now
8039  with any one of her own rank?  I suppose she will be married some day
8040  to a rough carter or a grinning ploughman.  Well, the fact of having
8041  met you, and loved you, will teach her to despise her husband, and she
8042  will be wretched.  From a moral point of view, I cannot say that I
8043  think much of your great renunciation.  Even as a beginning, it is
8044  poor.  Besides, how do you know that Hetty isn't floating at the
8045  present moment in some starlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies
8046  round her, like Ophelia?"
8047  
8048  "I can't bear this, Harry!  You mock at everything, and then suggest
8049  the most serious tragedies.  I am sorry I told you now.  I don't care
8050  what you say to me.  I know I was right in acting as I did.  Poor
8051  Hetty!  As I rode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at
8052  the window, like a spray of jasmine.  Don't let us talk about it any
8053  more, and don't try to persuade me that the first good action I have
8054  done for years, the first little bit of self-sacrifice I have ever
8055  known, is really a sort of sin.  I want to be better.  I am going to be
8056  better.  Tell me something about yourself.  What is going on in town?
8057  I have not been to the club for days."
8058  
8059  "The people are still discussing poor Basil's disappearance."
8060  
8061  "I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time," said
8062  Dorian, pouring himself out some wine and frowning slightly.
8063  
8064  "My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and
8065  the British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having
8066  more than one topic every three months.  They have been very fortunate
8067  lately, however.  They have had my own divorce-case and Alan Campbell's
8068  suicide.  Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist.
8069  Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left
8070  for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor
8071  Basil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris
8072  at all.  I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has
8073  been seen in San Francisco.  It is an odd thing, but every one who
8074  disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco.  It must be a
8075  delightful city, and possess all the attractions of the next world."
8076  
8077  "What do you think has happened to Basil?" asked Dorian, holding up his
8078  Burgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he could
8079  discuss the matter so calmly.
8080  
8081  "I have not the slightest idea.  If Basil chooses to hide himself, it
8082  is no business of mine.  If he is dead, I don't want to think about
8083  him.  Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me.  I hate it."
8084  
8085  "Why?" said the younger man wearily.
8086  
8087  "Because," said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the gilt
8088  trellis of an open vinaigrette box, "one can survive everything
8089  nowadays except that.  Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in
8090  the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away.  Let us have our
8091  coffee in the music-room, Dorian.  You must play Chopin to me.  The man
8092  with whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely.  Poor Victoria!
8093  I was very fond of her.  The house is rather lonely without her.  Of
8094  course, married life is merely a habit, a bad habit.  But then one
8095  regrets the loss even of one's worst habits.  Perhaps one regrets them
8096  the most.  They are such an essential part of one's personality."
8097  
8098  Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next
8099  room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white
8100  and black ivory of the keys.  After the coffee had been brought in, he
8101  stopped, and looking over at Lord Henry, said, "Harry, did it ever
8102  occur to you that Basil was murdered?"
8103  
8104  Lord Henry yawned.  "Basil was very popular, and always wore a
8105  Waterbury watch.  Why should he have been murdered?  He was not clever
8106  enough to have enemies.  Of course, he had a wonderful genius for
8107  painting.  But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as
8108  possible.  Basil was really rather dull.  He only interested me once,
8109  and that was when he told me, years ago, that he had a wild adoration
8110  for you and that you were the dominant motive of his art."
8111  
8112  "I was very fond of Basil," said Dorian with a note of sadness in his
8113  voice.  "But don't people say that he was murdered?"
8114  
8115  "Oh, some of the papers do.  It does not seem to me to be at all
8116  probable.  I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not
8117  the sort of man to have gone to them.  He had no curiosity.  It was his
8118  chief defect."
8119  
8120  "What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?"
8121  said the younger man.  He watched him intently after he had spoken.
8122  
8123  "I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that
8124  doesn't suit you.  All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime.
8125  It is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder.  I am sorry if I hurt
8126  your vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true.  Crime belongs
8127  exclusively to the lower orders.  I don't blame them in the smallest
8128  degree.  I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us,
8129  simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations."
8130  
8131  "A method of procuring sensations?  Do you think, then, that a man who
8132  has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again?
8133  Don't tell me that."
8134  
8135  "Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often," cried Lord
8136  Henry, laughing.  "That is one of the most important secrets of life.
8137  I should fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake.  One should
8138  never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner.  But let us
8139  pass from poor Basil.  I wish I could believe that he had come to such
8140  a really romantic end as you suggest, but I can't. I dare say he fell
8141  into the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the
8142  scandal.  Yes:  I should fancy that was his end.  I see him lying now
8143  on his back under those dull-green waters, with the heavy barges
8144  floating over him and long weeds catching in his hair.  Do you know, I
8145  don't think he would have done much more good work.  During the last
8146  ten years his painting had gone off very much."
8147  
8148  Dorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and began
8149  to stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large, grey-plumaged
8150  bird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing itself upon a bamboo
8151  perch.  As his pointed fingers touched it, it dropped the white scurf
8152  of crinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards
8153  and forwards.
8154  
8155  "Yes," he continued, turning round and taking his handkerchief out of
8156  his pocket; "his painting had quite gone off.  It seemed to me to have
8157  lost something.  It had lost an ideal.  When you and he ceased to be
8158  great friends, he ceased to be a great artist.  What was it separated
8159  you?  I suppose he bored you.  If so, he never forgave you.  It's a
8160  habit bores have.  By the way, what has become of that wonderful
8161  portrait he did of you?  I don't think I have ever seen it since he
8162  finished it.  Oh!  I remember your telling me years ago that you had
8163  sent it down to Selby, and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the
8164  way.  You never got it back?  What a pity! it was really a
8165  masterpiece.  I remember I wanted to buy it.  I wish I had now.  It
8166  belonged to Basil's best period.  Since then, his work was that curious
8167  mixture of bad painting and good intentions that always entitles a man
8168  to be called a representative British artist.  Did you advertise for
8169  it?  You should."
8170  
8171  "I forget," said Dorian.  "I suppose I did.  But I never really liked
8172  it.  I am sorry I sat for it.  The memory of the thing is hateful to
8173  me.  Why do you talk of it?  It used to remind me of those curious
8174  lines in some play--Hamlet, I think--how do they run?--
8175  
8176      "Like the painting of a sorrow,
8177       A face without a heart."
8178  
8179  Yes:  that is what it was like."
8180  
8181  Lord Henry laughed.  "If a man treats life artistically, his brain is
8182  his heart," he answered, sinking into an arm-chair.
8183  
8184  Dorian Gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the piano.
8185  "'Like the painting of a sorrow,'" he repeated, "'a face without a
8186  heart.'"
8187  
8188  The elder man lay back and looked at him with half-closed eyes.  "By
8189  the way, Dorian," he said after a pause, "'what does it profit a man if
8190  he gain the whole world and lose--how does the quotation run?--his own
8191  soul'?"
8192  
8193  The music jarred, and Dorian Gray started and stared at his friend.
8194  "Why do you ask me that, Harry?"
8195  
8196  "My dear fellow," said Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows in surprise,
8197  "I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer.
8198  That is all.  I was going through the park last Sunday, and close by
8199  the Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby-looking people
8200  listening to some vulgar street-preacher. As I passed by, I heard the
8201  man yelling out that question to his audience.  It struck me as being
8202  rather dramatic.  London is very rich in curious effects of that kind.
8203  A wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly
8204  white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful
8205  phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips--it was really very
8206  good in its way, quite a suggestion.  I thought of telling the prophet
8207  that art had a soul, but that man had not.  I am afraid, however, he
8208  would not have understood me."
8209  
8210  "Don't, Harry.  The soul is a terrible reality.  It can be bought, and
8211  sold, and bartered away.  It can be poisoned, or made perfect.  There
8212  is a soul in each one of us.  I know it."
8213  
8214  "Do you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?"
8215  
8216  "Quite sure."
8217  
8218  "Ah! then it must be an illusion.  The things one feels absolutely
8219  certain about are never true.  That is the fatality of faith, and the
8220  lesson of romance.  How grave you are!  Don't be so serious.  What have
8221  you or I to do with the superstitions of our age?  No:  we have given
8222  up our belief in the soul.  Play me something.  Play me a nocturne,
8223  Dorian, and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept
8224  your youth.  You must have some secret.  I am only ten years older than
8225  you are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow.  You are really
8226  wonderful, Dorian.  You have never looked more charming than you do
8227  to-night. You remind me of the day I saw you first.  You were rather
8228  cheeky, very shy, and absolutely extraordinary.  You have changed, of
8229  course, but not in appearance.  I wish you would tell me your secret.
8230  To get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take
8231  exercise, get up early, or be respectable.  Youth!  There is nothing
8232  like it.  It's absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth.  The only
8233  people to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are people much
8234  younger than myself.  They seem in front of me.  Life has revealed to
8235  them her latest wonder.  As for the aged, I always contradict the aged.
8236  I do it on principle.  If you ask them their opinion on something that
8237  happened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions current in
8238  1820, when people wore high stocks, believed in everything, and knew
8239  absolutely nothing.  How lovely that thing you are playing is!  I
8240  wonder, did Chopin write it at Majorca, with the sea weeping round the
8241  villa and the salt spray dashing against the panes?  It is marvellously
8242  romantic.  What a blessing it is that there is one art left to us that
8243  is not imitative!  Don't stop.  I want music to-night. It seems to me
8244  that you are the young Apollo and that I am Marsyas listening to you.
8245  I have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that even you know nothing of.  The
8246  tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young.  I am
8247  amazed sometimes at my own sincerity.  Ah, Dorian, how happy you are!
8248  What an exquisite life you have had!  You have drunk deeply of
8249  everything.  You have crushed the grapes against your palate.  Nothing
8250  has been hidden from you.  And it has all been to you no more than the
8251  sound of music.  It has not marred you.  You are still the same."
8252  
8253  "I am not the same, Harry."
8254  
8255  "Yes, you are the same.  I wonder what the rest of your life will be.
8256  Don't spoil it by renunciations.  At present you are a perfect type.
8257  Don't make yourself incomplete.  You are quite flawless now.  You need
8258  not shake your head:  you know you are.  Besides, Dorian, don't deceive
8259  yourself.  Life is not governed by will or intention.  Life is a
8260  question of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which
8261  thought hides itself and passion has its dreams.  You may fancy
8262  yourself safe and think yourself strong.  But a chance tone of colour
8263  in a room or a morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once
8264  loved and that brings subtle memories with it, a line from a forgotten
8265  poem that you had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music
8266  that you had ceased to play--I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things
8267  like these that our lives depend.  Browning writes about that
8268  somewhere; but our own senses will imagine them for us.  There are
8269  moments when the odour of _lilas blanc_ passes suddenly across me, and I
8270  have to live the strangest month of my life over again.  I wish I could
8271  change places with you, Dorian.  The world has cried out against us
8272  both, but it has always worshipped you.  It always will worship you.
8273  You are the type of what the age is searching for, and what it is
8274  afraid it has found.  I am so glad that you have never done anything,
8275  never carved a statue, or painted a picture, or produced anything
8276  outside of yourself!  Life has been your art.  You have set yourself to
8277  music.  Your days are your sonnets."
8278  
8279  Dorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair.
8280  "Yes, life has been exquisite," he murmured, "but I am not going to
8281  have the same life, Harry.  And you must not say these extravagant
8282  things to me.  You don't know everything about me.  I think that if you
8283  did, even you would turn from me.  You laugh.  Don't laugh."
8284  
8285  "Why have you stopped playing, Dorian?  Go back and give me the
8286  nocturne over again.  Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that
8287  hangs in the dusky air.  She is waiting for you to charm her, and if
8288  you play she will come closer to the earth.  You won't?  Let us go to
8289  the club, then.  It has been a charming evening, and we must end it
8290  charmingly.  There is some one at White's who wants immensely to know
8291  you--young Lord Poole, Bournemouth's eldest son.  He has already copied
8292  your neckties, and has begged me to introduce him to you.  He is quite
8293  delightful and rather reminds me of you."
8294  
8295  "I hope not," said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes.  "But I am tired
8296  to-night, Harry.  I shan't go to the club.  It is nearly eleven, and I
8297  want to go to bed early."
8298  
8299  "Do stay.  You have never played so well as to-night. There was
8300  something in your touch that was wonderful.  It had more expression
8301  than I had ever heard from it before."
8302  
8303  "It is because I am going to be good," he answered, smiling.  "I am a
8304  little changed already."
8305  
8306  "You cannot change to me, Dorian," said Lord Henry.  "You and I will
8307  always be friends."
8308  
8309  "Yet you poisoned me with a book once.  I should not forgive that.
8310  Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one.  It
8311  does harm."
8312  
8313  "My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize.  You will soon be
8314  going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people
8315  against all the sins of which you have grown tired.  You are much too
8316  delightful to do that.  Besides, it is no use.  You and I are what we
8317  are, and will be what we will be.  As for being poisoned by a book,
8318  there is no such thing as that.  Art has no influence upon action.  It
8319  annihilates the desire to act.  It is superbly sterile.  The books that
8320  the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.
8321  That is all.  But we won't discuss literature.  Come round to-morrow. I
8322  am going to ride at eleven.  We might go together, and I will take you
8323  to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome.  She is a charming woman, and
8324  wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying.
8325  Mind you come.  Or shall we lunch with our little duchess?  She says
8326  she never sees you now.  Perhaps you are tired of Gladys?  I thought
8327  you would be.  Her clever tongue gets on one's nerves.  Well, in any
8328  case, be here at eleven."
8329  
8330  "Must I really come, Harry?"
8331  
8332  "Certainly.  The park is quite lovely now.  I don't think there have
8333  been such lilacs since the year I met you."
8334  
8335  "Very well.  I shall be here at eleven," said Dorian.  "Good night,
8336  Harry."  As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment, as if he
8337  had something more to say.  Then he sighed and went out.
8338  
8339  
8340  
8341  CHAPTER 20
8342  
8343  It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and
8344  did not even put his silk scarf round his throat.  As he strolled home,
8345  smoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him.  He
8346  heard one of them whisper to the other, "That is Dorian Gray." He
8347  remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared
8348  at, or talked about.  He was tired of hearing his own name now.  Half
8349  the charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was
8350  that no one knew who he was.  He had often told the girl whom he had
8351  lured to love him that he was poor, and she had believed him.  He had
8352  told her once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and
8353  answered that wicked people were always very old and very ugly.  What a
8354  laugh she had!--just like a thrush singing.  And how pretty she had
8355  been in her cotton dresses and her large hats!  She knew nothing, but
8356  she had everything that he had lost.
8357  
8358  When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him.  He sent
8359  him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and
8360  began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.
8361  
8362  Was it really true that one could never change?  He felt a wild longing
8363  for the unstained purity of his boyhood--his rose-white boyhood, as
8364  Lord Henry had once called it.  He knew that he had tarnished himself,
8365  filled his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he
8366  had been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible
8367  joy in being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had
8368  been the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to
8369  shame.  But was it all irretrievable?  Was there no hope for him?
8370  
8371  Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that
8372  the portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the
8373  unsullied splendour of eternal youth!  All his failure had been due to
8374  that.  Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure
8375  swift penalty along with it.  There was purification in punishment.
8376  Not "Forgive us our sins" but "Smite us for our iniquities" should be
8377  the prayer of man to a most just God.
8378  
8379  The curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many
8380  years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids
8381  laughed round it as of old.  He took it up, as he had done on that
8382  night of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal
8383  picture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished
8384  shield.  Once, some one who had terribly loved him had written to him a
8385  mad letter, ending with these idolatrous words: "The world is changed
8386  because you are made of ivory and gold.  The curves of your lips
8387  rewrite history."  The phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated
8388  them over and over to himself.  Then he loathed his own beauty, and
8389  flinging the mirror on the floor, crushed it into silver splinters
8390  beneath his heel.  It was his beauty that had ruined him, his beauty
8391  and the youth that he had prayed for.  But for those two things, his
8392  life might have been free from stain.  His beauty had been to him but a
8393  mask, his youth but a mockery.  What was youth at best?  A green, an
8394  unripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts.  Why had he
8395  worn its livery?  Youth had spoiled him.
8396  
8397  It was better not to think of the past.  Nothing could alter that.  It
8398  was of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think.  James
8399  Vane was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard.  Alan Campbell
8400  had shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the
8401  secret that he had been forced to know.  The excitement, such as it
8402  was, over Basil Hallward's disappearance would soon pass away.  It was
8403  already waning.  He was perfectly safe there.  Nor, indeed, was it the
8404  death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind.  It was the
8405  living death of his own soul that troubled him.  Basil had painted the
8406  portrait that had marred his life.  He could not forgive him that.  It
8407  was the portrait that had done everything.  Basil had said things to
8408  him that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience.  The
8409  murder had been simply the madness of a moment.  As for Alan Campbell,
8410  his suicide had been his own act.  He had chosen to do it.  It was
8411  nothing to him.
8412  
8413  A new life!  That was what he wanted.  That was what he was waiting
8414  for.  Surely he had begun it already.  He had spared one innocent
8415  thing, at any rate.  He would never again tempt innocence.  He would be
8416  good.
8417  
8418  As he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in
8419  the locked room had changed.  Surely it was not still so horrible as it
8420  had been?  Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel
8421  every sign of evil passion from the face.  Perhaps the signs of evil
8422  had already gone away.  He would go and look.
8423  
8424  He took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs.  As he unbarred the
8425  door, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face
8426  and lingered for a moment about his lips.  Yes, he would be good, and
8427  the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror
8428  to him.  He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.
8429  
8430  He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and
8431  dragged the purple hanging from the portrait.  A cry of pain and
8432  indignation broke from him.  He could see no change, save that in the
8433  eyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of
8434  the hypocrite.  The thing was still loathsome--more loathsome, if
8435  possible, than before--and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed
8436  brighter, and more like blood newly spilled.  Then he trembled.  Had it
8437  been merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed?  Or the
8438  desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking
8439  laugh?  Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things
8440  finer than we are ourselves?  Or, perhaps, all these?  And why was the
8441  red stain larger than it had been?  It seemed to have crept like a
8442  horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers.  There was blood on the
8443  painted feet, as though the thing had dripped--blood even on the hand
8444  that had not held the knife.  Confess?  Did it mean that he was to
8445  confess?  To give himself up and be put to death?  He laughed.  He felt
8446  that the idea was monstrous.  Besides, even if he did confess, who
8447  would believe him?  There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.
8448  Everything belonging to him had been destroyed.  He himself had burned
8449  what had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad.
8450  They would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was
8451  his duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public
8452  atonement.  There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to
8453  earth as well as to heaven.  Nothing that he could do would cleanse him
8454  till he had told his own sin.  His sin?  He shrugged his shoulders.
8455  The death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him.  He was thinking
8456  of Hetty Merton.  For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul
8457  that he was looking at.  Vanity?  Curiosity?  Hypocrisy?  Had there
8458  been nothing more in his renunciation than that?  There had been
8459  something more.  At least he thought so.  But who could tell? ... No.
8460  There had been nothing more.  Through vanity he had spared her.  In
8461  hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness.  For curiosity's sake he
8462  had tried the denial of self.  He recognized that now.
8463  
8464  But this murder--was it to dog him all his life?  Was he always to be
8465  burdened by his past?  Was he really to confess?  Never.  There was
8466  only one bit of evidence left against him.  The picture itself--that
8467  was evidence.  He would destroy it.  Why had he kept it so long?  Once
8468  it had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old.  Of
8469  late he had felt no such pleasure.  It had kept him awake at night.
8470  When he had been away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes
8471  should look upon it.  It had brought melancholy across his passions.
8472  Its mere memory had marred many moments of joy.  It had been like
8473  conscience to him.  Yes, it had been conscience.  He would destroy it.
8474  
8475  He looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward.  He
8476  had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it.  It
8477  was bright, and glistened.  As it had killed the painter, so it would
8478  kill the painter's work, and all that that meant.  It would kill the
8479  past, and when that was dead, he would be free.  It would kill this
8480  monstrous soul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he would be at
8481  peace.  He seized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it.
8482  
8483  There was a cry heard, and a crash.  The cry was so horrible in its
8484  agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms.
8485  Two gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked
8486  up at the great house.  They walked on till they met a policeman and
8487  brought him back.  The man rang the bell several times, but there was
8488  no answer.  Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was
8489  all dark.  After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico
8490  and watched.
8491  
8492  "Whose house is that, Constable?" asked the elder of the two gentlemen.
8493  
8494  "Mr. Dorian Gray's, sir," answered the policeman.
8495  
8496  They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered.  One of

8504  footmen and crept upstairs.  They knocked, but there was no reply.
8505  They called out.  Everything was still.  Finally, after vainly trying
8506  to force the door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the
8507  balcony.  The windows yielded easily--their bolts were old.

8510  of their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his
8511  exquisite youth and beauty.  Lying on the floor was a dead man, in
8512  evening dress, with a knife in his heart.  He was withered, wrinkled,
8513  and loathsome of visage.  It was not till they had examined the rings
8514  that they recognized who it was.
