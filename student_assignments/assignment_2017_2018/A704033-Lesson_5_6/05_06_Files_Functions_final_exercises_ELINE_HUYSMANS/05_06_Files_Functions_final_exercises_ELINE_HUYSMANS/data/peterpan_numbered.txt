1 Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH
2 
3 All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow
4 up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old
5 she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with
6 it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for
7 Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, “Oh, why can’t you
8 remain like this for ever!” This was all that passed between them on
9 the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always
10 know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.
11 
12 Of course they lived at 14 [their house number on their street], and
13 until Wendy came her mother was the chief one. She was a lovely lady,
14 with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Her romantic
15 mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the
16 puzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and
17 her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get,
18 though there it was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.
19 
20 The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been
21 boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her,
22 and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who
23 took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her. He got all of her,
24 except the innermost box and the kiss. He never knew about the box, and
25 in time he gave up trying for the kiss. Wendy thought Napoleon could
26 have got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a
27 passion, slamming the door.
28 
29 Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him
30 but respected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks
31 and shares. Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know,
32 and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that
33 would have made any woman respect him.
34 
35 Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books
36 perfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a
37 Brussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped
38 out, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces.
39 She drew them when she should have been totting up. They were Mrs.
40 Darling’s guesses.
41 
42 Wendy came first, then John, then Michael.
43 
44 For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would
45 be able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was
46 frightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the
47 edge of Mrs. Darling’s bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses,
48 while she looked at him imploringly. She wanted to risk it, come what
49 might, but that was not his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece
50 of paper, and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at
51 the beginning again.
52 
53 “Now don’t interrupt,” he would beg of her.
54 
55 “I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can
56 cut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine
57 and six, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five
58 naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven--who is that
59 moving?--eight nine seven, dot and carry seven--don’t speak, my own--and
60 the pound you lent to that man who came to the door--quiet, child--dot
61 and carry child--there, you’ve done it!--did I say nine nine seven? yes,
62 I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on
63 nine nine seven?”
64 
65 “Of course we can, George,” she cried. But she was prejudiced in Wendy’s
66 favour, and he was really the grander character of the two.
67 
68 “Remember mumps,” he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went
69 again. “Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay
70 it will be more like thirty shillings--don’t speak--measles one five,
71 German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six--don’t waggle your
72 finger--whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings”--and so on it went, and
73 it added up differently each time; but at last Wendy just got through,
74 with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated
75 as one.
76 
77 There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower
78 squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of
79 them going in a row to Miss Fulsom’s Kindergarten school, accompanied by
80 their nurse.
81 
82 Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a
83 passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had
84 a nurse. As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children
85 drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had
86 belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. She had
87 always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become
88 acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her
89 spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless
90 nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their
91 mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How thorough
92 she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her
93 charges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the nursery.
94 She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience
95 with and when it needs stocking around your throat. She believed to her
96 last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of
97 contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on. It was a
98 lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school, walking
99 sedately by their side when they were well behaved, and butting them
100 back into line if they strayed. On John’s footer [in England soccer
101 was called football, “footer” for short] days she never once forgot his
102 sweater, and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of
103 rain. There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom’s school where the
104 nurses wait. They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that
105 was the only difference. They affected to ignore her as of an inferior
106 social status to themselves, and she despised their light talk. She
107 resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling’s friends, but if they
108 did come she first whipped off Michael’s pinafore and put him into the
109 one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John’s
110 hair.
111 
112 No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and
113 Mr. Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the
114 neighbours talked.
115 
116 He had his position in the city to consider.
117 
118 Nana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that
119 she did not admire him. “I know she admires you tremendously, George,”
120  Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children
121 to be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the
122 only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget
123 she looked in her long skirt and maid’s cap, though she had sworn, when
124 engaged, that she would never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps!
125 And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that
126 all you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at her
127 you might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family until
128 the coming of Peter Pan.
129 
130 Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children’s
131 minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children
132 are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next
133 morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have
134 wandered during the day. If you could keep awake (but of course you
135 can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it
136 very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You
137 would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of
138 your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up,
139 making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as
140 if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight.
141 When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with
142 which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom
143 of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your
144 prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.
145 
146 I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind.
147 Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can
148 become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a
149 child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all
150 the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a
151 card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is
152 always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here
153 and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and
154 savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves
155 through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a
156 hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose.
157 It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day
158 at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders,
159 hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting
160 into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth
161 yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are
162 another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially
163 as nothing will stand still.
164 
165 Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a
166 lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while
167 Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over
168 it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in
169 a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no
170 friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by
171 its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance,
172 and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have
173 each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play
174 are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been
175 there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no
176 more.
177 
178 Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most
179 compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between
180 one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by
181 day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming,
182 but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That
183 is why there are night-lights.
184 
185 Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling
186 found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most
187 perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was
188 here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be
189 scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than
190 any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had
191 an oddly cocky appearance.
192 
193 “Yes, he is rather cocky,” Wendy admitted with regret. Her mother had
194 been questioning her.
195 
196 “But who is he, my pet?”
197 
198 “He is Peter Pan, you know, mother.”
199 
200 At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her
201 childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the
202 fairies. There were odd stories about him, as that when children died he
203 went part of the way with them, so that they should not be frightened.
204 She had believed in him at the time, but now that she was married and
205 full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person.
206 
207 “Besides,” she said to Wendy, “he would be grown up by this time.”
208 
209 “Oh no, he isn’t grown up,” Wendy assured her confidently, “and he is
210 just my size.” She meant that he was her size in both mind and body; she
211 didn’t know how she knew, she just knew it.
212 
213 Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh. “Mark my
214 words,” he said, “it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their
215 heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and it
216 will blow over.”
217 
218 But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs.
219 Darling quite a shock.
220 
221 Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them.
222 For instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event
223 happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead
224 father and had a game with him. It was in this casual way that Wendy one
225 morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a tree had been
226 found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the
227 children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy
228 said with a tolerant smile:
229 
230 “I do believe it is that Peter again!”
231 
232 “Whatever do you mean, Wendy?”
233 
234 “It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,” Wendy said, sighing. She
235 was a tidy child.
236 
237 She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter
238 sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her
239 bed and played on his pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so she
240 didn’t know how she knew, she just knew.
241 
242 “What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house without
243 knocking.”
244 
245 “I think he comes in by the window,” she said.
246 
247 “My love, it is three floors up.”
248 
249 “Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?”
250 
251 It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.
252 
253 Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to
254 Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.
255 
256 “My child,” the mother cried, “why did you not tell me of this before?”
257 
258 “I forgot,” said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get her breakfast.
259 
260 Oh, surely she must have been dreaming.
261 
262 But, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined
263 them very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they
264 did not come from any tree that grew in England. She crawled about the
265 floor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot. She
266 rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls. She let down a
267 tape from the window to the pavement, and it was a sheer drop of thirty
268 feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.
269 
270 Certainly Wendy had been dreaming.
271 
272 But Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the
273 night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be
274 said to have begun.
275 
276 On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It
277 happened to be Nana’s evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and
278 sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into
279 the land of sleep.
280 
281 All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and
282 sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.
283 
284 It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into
285 shirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three
286 night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling’s lap. Then
287 her head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of
288 them, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the
289 fire. There should have been a fourth night-light.
290 
291 While she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come
292 too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not
293 alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many
294 women who have no children. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of
295 some mothers also. But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures
296 the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through
297 the gap.
298 
299 The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming
300 the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor.
301 He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which
302 darted about the room like a living thing and I think it must have been
303 this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.
304 
305 She started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at once
306 that he was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there we should
307 have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling’s kiss. He was a lovely
308 boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but
309 the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth.
310 When he saw she was a grown-up, he gnashed the little pearls at her.
311 
312 
313 
314 
315 Chapter 2 THE SHADOW
316 
317 Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened,
318 and Nana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang
319 at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling
320 screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed,
321 and she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it
322 was not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see
323 nothing but what she thought was a shooting star.
324 
325 She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth,
326 which proved to be the boy’s shadow. As he leapt at the window Nana had
327 closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had
328 time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.
329 
330 You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was
331 quite the ordinary kind.
332 
333 Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow. She
334 hung it out at the window, meaning “He is sure to come back for it; let
335 us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the children.”
336 
337 But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the
338 window, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the
339 house. She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up
340 winter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his
341 head to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him;
342 besides, she knew exactly what he would say: “It all comes of having a
343 dog for a nurse.”
344 
345 She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer,
346 until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband. Ah me!
347 
348 The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday.
349 Of course it was a Friday.
350 
351 “I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,” she used to say
352 afterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of
353 her, holding her hand.
354 
355 “No, no,” Mr. Darling always said, “I am responsible for it all. I,
356 George Darling, did it. MEA CULPA, MEA CULPA.” He had had a classical
357 education.
358 
359 They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every
360 detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other
361 side like the faces on a bad coinage.
362 
363 “If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,” Mrs. Darling
364 said.
365 
366 “If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana’s bowl,” said Mr.
367 Darling.
368 
369 “If only I had pretended to like the medicine,” was what Nana’s wet eyes
370 said.
371 
372 “My liking for parties, George.”
373 
374 “My fatal gift of humour, dearest.”
375 
376 “My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.”
377 
378 Then one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the
379 thought, “It’s true, it’s true, they ought not to have had a dog for
380 a nurse.” Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to
381 Nana’s eyes.
382 
383 “That fiend!” Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana’s bark was the echo of
384 it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the
385 right-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.
386 
387 They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every
388 smallest detail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully,
389 so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the
390 water for Michael’s bath and carrying him to it on her back.
391 
392 “I won’t go to bed,” he had shouted, like one who still believed that he
393 had the last word on the subject, “I won’t, I won’t. Nana, it isn’t six
394 o’clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I shan’t love you any more, Nana. I tell
395 you I won’t be bathed, I won’t, I won’t!”
396 
397 Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had
398 dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown,
399 with the necklace George had given her. She was wearing Wendy’s bracelet
400 on her arm; she had asked for the loan of it. Wendy loved to lend her
401 bracelet to her mother.
402 
403 She had found her two older children playing at being herself and father
404 on the occasion of Wendy’s birth, and John was saying:
405 
406 “I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother,”
407  in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real
408 occasion.
409 
410 Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done.
411 
412 Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the
413 birth of a male, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also,
414 but John said brutally that they did not want any more.
415 
416 Michael had nearly cried. “Nobody wants me,” he said, and of course the
417 lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.
418 
419 “I do,” she said, “I so want a third child.”
420 
421 “Boy or girl?” asked Michael, not too hopefully.
422 
423 “Boy.”
424 
425 Then he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs.
426 Darling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be
427 Michael’s last night in the nursery.
428 
429 They go on with their recollections.
430 
431 “It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn’t it?” Mr. Darling
432 would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado.
433 
434 Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for
435 the party, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. It
436 is an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew
437 about stocks and shares, had no real mastery of his tie. Sometimes the
438 thing yielded to him without a contest, but there were occasions when it
439 would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and
440 used a made-up tie.
441 
442 This was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with the
443 crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.
444 
445 “Why, what is the matter, father dear?”
446 
447 “Matter!” he yelled; he really yelled. “This tie, it will not tie.” He
448 became dangerously sarcastic. “Not round my neck! Round the bed-post!
449 Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my
450 neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused!”
451 
452 He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on
453 sternly, “I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my
454 neck we don’t go out to dinner to-night, and if I don’t go out to dinner
455 to-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don’t go to the
456 office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into the
457 streets.”
458 
459 Even then Mrs. Darling was placid. “Let me try, dear,” she said, and
460 indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice
461 cool hands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to
462 see their fate decided. Some men would have resented her being able to
463 do it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he
464 thanked her carelessly, at once forgot his rage, and in another moment
465 was dancing round the room with Michael on his back.
466 
467 “How wildly we romped!” says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.
468 
469 “Our last romp!” Mr. Darling groaned.
470 
471 “O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, ‘How did you get
472 to know me, mother?’”
473 
474 “I remember!”
475 
476 “They were rather sweet, don’t you think, George?”
477 
478 “And they were ours, ours! and now they are gone.”
479 
480 The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr.
481 Darling collided against her, covering his trousers with hairs. They
482 were not only new trousers, but they were the first he had ever had
483 with braid on them, and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears
484 coming. Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him, but he began to talk again
485 about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse.
486 
487 “George, Nana is a treasure.”
488 
489 “No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the
490 children as puppies.”
491 
492 “Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls.”
493 
494 “I wonder,” Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, “I wonder.” It was an
495 opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy. At first he
496 pooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him the
497 shadow.
498 
499 “It is nobody I know,” he said, examining it carefully, “but it does
500 look a scoundrel.”
501 
502 “We were still discussing it, you remember,” says Mr. Darling, “when
503 Nana came in with Michael’s medicine. You will never carry the bottle in
504 your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.”
505 
506 Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather
507 foolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness, it was for thinking
508 that all his life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when Michael
509 dodged the spoon in Nana’s mouth, he had said reprovingly, “Be a man,
510 Michael.”
511 
512 “Won’t; won’t!” Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling left the room to
513 get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of
514 firmness.
515 
516 “Mother, don’t pamper him,” he called after her. “Michael, when I was
517 your age I took medicine without a murmur. I said, ‘Thank you, kind
518 parents, for giving me bottles to make me well.’”
519 
520 He really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her
521 night-gown, believed it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, “That
522 medicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn’t it?”
523 
524 “Ever so much nastier,” Mr. Darling said bravely, “and I would take it
525 now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn’t lost the bottle.”
526 
527 He had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the
528 top of the wardrobe and hidden it there. What he did not know was that
529 the faithful Liza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand.
530 
531 “I know where it is, father,” Wendy cried, always glad to be of service.
532 “I’ll bring it,” and she was off before he could stop her. Immediately
533 his spirits sank in the strangest way.
534 
535 “John,” he said, shuddering, “it’s most beastly stuff. It’s that nasty,
536 sticky, sweet kind.”
537 
538 “It will soon be over, father,” John said cheerily, and then in rushed
539 Wendy with the medicine in a glass.
540 
541 “I have been as quick as I could,” she panted.
542 
543 “You have been wonderfully quick,” her father retorted, with a
544 vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. “Michael
545 first,” he said doggedly.
546 
547 “Father first,” said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature.
548 
549 “I shall be sick, you know,” Mr. Darling said threateningly.
550 
551 “Come on, father,” said John.
552 
553 “Hold your tongue, John,” his father rapped out.
554 
555 Wendy was quite puzzled. “I thought you took it quite easily, father.”
556 
557 “That is not the point,” he retorted. “The point is, that there is
558 more in my glass than in Michael’s spoon.” His proud heart was nearly
559 bursting. “And it isn’t fair: I would say it though it were with my last
560 breath; it isn’t fair.”
561 
562 “Father, I am waiting,” said Michael coldly.
563 
564 “It’s all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting.”
565 
566 “Father’s a cowardly custard.”
567 
568 “So are you a cowardly custard.”
569 
570 “I’m not frightened.”
571 
572 “Neither am I frightened.”
573 
574 “Well, then, take it.”
575 
576 “Well, then, you take it.”
577 
578 Wendy had a splendid idea. “Why not both take it at the same time?”
579 
580 “Certainly,” said Mr. Darling. “Are you ready, Michael?”
581 
582 Wendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his medicine,
583 but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back.
584 
585 There was a yell of rage from Michael, and “O father!” Wendy exclaimed.
586 
587 “What do you mean by ‘O father’?” Mr. Darling demanded. “Stop that row,
588 Michael. I meant to take mine, but I--I missed it.”
589 
590 It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if
591 they did not admire him. “Look here, all of you,” he said entreatingly,
592 as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. “I have just thought of a
593 splendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into Nana’s bowl, and she will
594 drink it, thinking it is milk!”
595 
596 It was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father’s
597 sense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the
598 medicine into Nana’s bowl. “What fun!” he said doubtfully, and they did
599 not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned.
600 
601 “Nana, good dog,” he said, patting her, “I have put a little milk into
602 your bowl, Nana.”
603 
604 Nana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then
605 she gave Mr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the
606 great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her
607 kennel.
608 
609 Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give
610 in. In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. “O George,” she
611 said, “it’s your medicine!”
612 
613 “It was only a joke,” he roared, while she comforted her boys, and Wendy
614 hugged Nana. “Much good,” he said bitterly, “my wearing myself to the
615 bone trying to be funny in this house.”
616 
617 And still Wendy hugged Nana. “That’s right,” he shouted. “Coddle her!
618 Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner, why should I
619 be coddled--why, why, why!”
620 
621 “George,” Mrs. Darling entreated him, “not so loud; the servants
622 will hear you.” Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the
623 servants.
624 
625 “Let them!” he answered recklessly. “Bring in the whole world. But I
626 refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer.”
627 
628 The children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her
629 back. He felt he was a strong man again. “In vain, in vain,” he cried;
630 “the proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up
631 this instant.”
632 
633 “George, George,” Mrs. Darling whispered, “remember what I told you
634 about that boy.”
635 
636 Alas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was master in
637 that house, and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he
638 lured her out of it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly, dragged
639 her from the nursery. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did it.
640 It was all owing to his too affectionate nature, which craved for
641 admiration. When he had tied her up in the back-yard, the wretched
642 father went and sat in the passage, with his knuckles to his eyes.
643 
644 In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted
645 silence and lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana barking, and
646 John whimpered, “It is because he is chaining her up in the yard,” but
647 Wendy was wiser.
648 
649 “That is not Nana’s unhappy bark,” she said, little guessing what was
650 about to happen; “that is her bark when she smells danger.”
651 
652 Danger!
653 
654 “Are you sure, Wendy?”
655 
656 “Oh, yes.”
657 
658 Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened.
659 She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were
660 crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place
661 there, but she did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller
662 ones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made
663 her cry, “Oh, how I wish that I wasn’t going to a party to-night!”
664 
665 Even Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed, and he
666 asked, “Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?”
667 
668 “Nothing, precious,” she said; “they are the eyes a mother leaves behind
669 her to guard her children.”
670 
671 She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little
672 Michael flung his arms round her. “Mother,” he cried, “I’m glad of you.”
673  They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long time.
674 
675 No. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall of
676 snow, and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly not
677 to soil their shoes. They were already the only persons in the street,
678 and all the stars were watching them. Stars are beautiful, but they may
679 not take an active part in anything, they must just look on for ever. It
680 is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no
681 star now knows what it was. So the older ones have become glassy-eyed
682 and seldom speak (winking is the star language), but the little
683 ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, who had a
684 mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out;
685 but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to-night, and
686 anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon as the door
687 of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the
688 firmament, and the smallest of all the stars in the Milky Way screamed
689 out:
690 
691 “Now, Peter!”
692 
693 
694 
695 
696 Chapter 3 COME AWAY, COME AWAY!
697 
698 For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights
699 by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly. They were
700 awfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they
701 could have kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy’s light blinked and gave
702 such a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before they could close
703 their mouths all the three went out.
704 
705 There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than
706 the night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been
707 in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter’s shadow, rummaged
708 the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out. It was not really a
709 light; it made this light by flashing about so quickly, but when it came
710 to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy, no longer than your hand,
711 but still growing. It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned
712 in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through which her figure could
713 be seen to the best advantage. She was slightly inclined to EMBONPOINT.
714 [plump hourglass figure]
715 
716 A moment after the fairy’s entrance the window was blown open by the
717 breathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in. He had carried
718 Tinker Bell part of the way, and his hand was still messy with the fairy
719 dust.
720 
721 “Tinker Bell,” he called softly, after making sure that the children
722 were asleep, “Tink, where are you?” She was in a jug for the moment, and
723 liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.
724 
725 “Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put my
726 shadow?”
727 
728 The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy
729 language. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to
730 hear it you would know that you had heard it once before.
731 
732 Tink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of
733 drawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to
734 the floor with both hands, as kings toss ha’pence to the crowd. In a
735 moment he had recovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that he
736 had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer.
737 
738 If he thought at all, but I don’t believe he ever thought, it was that
739 he and his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops
740 of water, and when they did not he was appalled. He tried to stick it
741 on with soap from the bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed
742 through Peter, and he sat on the floor and cried.
743 
744 His sobs woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed. She was not alarmed to see
745 a stranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only pleasantly
746 interested.
747 
748 “Boy,” she said courteously, “why are you crying?”
749 
750 Peter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner at
751 fairy ceremonies, and he rose and bowed to her beautifully. She was much
752 pleased, and bowed beautifully to him from the bed.
753 
754 “What’s your name?” he asked.
755 
756 “Wendy Moira Angela Darling,” she replied with some satisfaction. “What
757 is your name?”
758 
759 “Peter Pan.”
760 
761 She was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a
762 comparatively short name.
763 
764 “Is that all?”
765 
766 “Yes,” he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that it was a
767 shortish name.
768 
769 “I’m so sorry,” said Wendy Moira Angela.
770 
771 “It doesn’t matter,” Peter gulped.
772 
773 She asked where he lived.
774 
775 “Second to the right,” said Peter, “and then straight on till morning.”
776 
777 “What a funny address!”
778 
779 Peter had a sinking. For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a
780 funny address.
781 
782 “No, it isn’t,” he said.
783 
784 “I mean,” Wendy said nicely, remembering that she was hostess, “is that
785 what they put on the letters?”
786 
787 He wished she had not mentioned letters.
788 
789 “Don’t get any letters,” he said contemptuously.
790 
791 “But your mother gets letters?”
792 
793 “Don’t have a mother,” he said. Not only had he no mother, but he had
794 not the slightest desire to have one. He thought them very over-rated
795 persons. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in the presence of a
796 tragedy.
797 
798 “O Peter, no wonder you were crying,” she said, and got out of bed and
799 ran to him.
800 
801 “I wasn’t crying about mothers,” he said rather indignantly. “I was
802 crying because I can’t get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I wasn’t
803 crying.”
804 
805 “It has come off?”
806 
807 “Yes.”
808 
809 Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she was
810 frightfully sorry for Peter. “How awful!” she said, but she could not
811 help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with
812 soap. How exactly like a boy!
813 
814 Fortunately she knew at once what to do. “It must be sewn on,” she said,
815 just a little patronisingly.
816 
817 “What’s sewn?” he asked.
818 
819 “You’re dreadfully ignorant.”
820 
821 “No, I’m not.”
822 
823 But she was exulting in his ignorance. “I shall sew it on for you, my
824 little man,” she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out
825 her housewife [sewing bag], and sewed the shadow on to Peter’s foot.
826 
827 “I daresay it will hurt a little,” she warned him.
828 
829 “Oh, I shan’t cry,” said Peter, who was already of the opinion that he
830 had never cried in his life. And he clenched his teeth and did not
831 cry, and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a little
832 creased.
833 
834 “Perhaps I should have ironed it,” Wendy said thoughtfully, but Peter,
835 boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about in
836 the wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss
837 to Wendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself. “How clever I
838 am!” he crowed rapturously, “oh, the cleverness of me!”
839 
840 It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was
841 one of his most fascinating qualities. To put it with brutal frankness,
842 there never was a cockier boy.
843 
844 But for the moment Wendy was shocked. “You conceit [braggart],” she
845 exclaimed, with frightful sarcasm; “of course I did nothing!”
846 
847 “You did a little,” Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance.
848 
849 “A little!” she replied with hauteur [pride]; “if I am no use I can at
850 least withdraw,” and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and
851 covered her face with the blankets.
852 
853 To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when this
854 failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot.
855 “Wendy,” he said, “don’t withdraw. I can’t help crowing, Wendy, when
856 I’m pleased with myself.” Still she would not look up, though she was
857 listening eagerly. “Wendy,” he continued, in a voice that no woman has
858 ever yet been able to resist, “Wendy, one girl is more use than twenty
859 boys.”
860 
861 Now Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very many
862 inches, and she peeped out of the bed-clothes.
863 
864 “Do you really think so, Peter?”
865 
866 “Yes, I do.”
867 
868 “I think it’s perfectly sweet of you,” she declared, “and I’ll get up
869 again,” and she sat with him on the side of the bed. She also said
870 she would give him a kiss if he liked, but Peter did not know what she
871 meant, and he held out his hand expectantly.
872 
873 “Surely you know what a kiss is?” she asked, aghast.
874 
875 “I shall know when you give it to me,” he replied stiffly, and not to
876 hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble.
877 
878 “Now,” said he, “shall I give you a kiss?” and she replied with a slight
879 primness, “If you please.” She made herself rather cheap by inclining
880 her face toward him, but he merely dropped an acorn button into her
881 hand, so she slowly returned her face to where it had been before, and
882 said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain around her neck.
883 It was lucky that she did put it on that chain, for it was afterwards to
884 save her life.
885 
886 When people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to
887 ask each other’s age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct
888 thing, asked Peter how old he was. It was not really a happy question to
889 ask him; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar, when what
890 you want to be asked is Kings of England.
891 
892 “I don’t know,” he replied uneasily, “but I am quite young.” He really
893 knew nothing about it, he had merely suspicions, but he said at a
894 venture, “Wendy, I ran away the day I was born.”
895 
896 Wendy was quite surprised, but interested; and she indicated in the
897 charming drawing-room manner, by a touch on her night-gown, that he
898 could sit nearer her.
899 
900 “It was because I heard father and mother,” he explained in a low
901 voice, “talking about what I was to be when I became a man.” He was
902 extraordinarily agitated now. “I don’t want ever to be a man,” he said
903 with passion. “I want always to be a little boy and to have fun. So
904 I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the
905 fairies.”
906 
907 She gave him a look of the most intense admiration, and he thought it
908 was because he had run away, but it was really because he knew fairies.
909 Wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as
910 quite delightful. She poured out questions about them, to his surprise,
911 for they were rather a nuisance to him, getting in his way and so on,
912 and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding [spanking]. Still, he
913 liked them on the whole, and he told her about the beginning of fairies.
914 
915 “You see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time, its
916 laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about,
917 and that was the beginning of fairies.”
918 
919 Tedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home she liked it.
920 
921 “And so,” he went on good-naturedly, “there ought to be one fairy for
922 every boy and girl.”
923 
924 “Ought to be? Isn’t there?”
925 
926 “No. You see children know such a lot now, they soon don’t believe in
927 fairies, and every time a child says, ‘I don’t believe in fairies,’
928 there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead.”
929 
930 Really, he thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and it
931 struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet. “I can’t think where
932 she has gone to,” he said, rising, and he called Tink by name. Wendy’s
933 heart went flutter with a sudden thrill.
934 
935 “Peter,” she cried, clutching him, “you don’t mean to tell me that there
936 is a fairy in this room!”
937 
938 “She was here just now,” he said a little impatiently. “You don’t hear
939 her, do you?” and they both listened.
940 
941 “The only sound I hear,” said Wendy, “is like a tinkle of bells.”
942 
943 “Well, that’s Tink, that’s the fairy language. I think I hear her too.”
944 
945 The sound came from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry face.
946 No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter, and the loveliest of
947 gurgles was his laugh. He had his first laugh still.
948 
949 “Wendy,” he whispered gleefully, “I do believe I shut her up in the
950 drawer!”
951 
952 He let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she flew about the nursery
953 screaming with fury. “You shouldn’t say such things,” Peter retorted.
954 “Of course I’m very sorry, but how could I know you were in the drawer?”
955 
956 Wendy was not listening to him. “O Peter,” she cried, “if she would only
957 stand still and let me see her!”
958 
959 “They hardly ever stand still,” he said, but for one moment Wendy saw
960 the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock. “O the lovely!”
961  she cried, though Tink’s face was still distorted with passion.
962 
963 “Tink,” said Peter amiably, “this lady says she wishes you were her
964 fairy.”
965 
966 Tinker Bell answered insolently.
967 
968 “What does she say, Peter?”
969 
970 He had to translate. “She is not very polite. She says you are a great
971 [huge] ugly girl, and that she is my fairy.”
972 
973 He tried to argue with Tink. “You know you can’t be my fairy, Tink,
974 because I am an gentleman and you are a lady.”
975 
976 To this Tink replied in these words, “You silly ass,” and disappeared
977 into the bathroom. “She is quite a common fairy,” Peter explained
978 apologetically, “she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots
979 and kettles [tinker = tin worker].” [Similar to “cinder” plus “elle” to
980 get Cinderella]
981 
982 They were together in the armchair by this time, and Wendy plied him
983 with more questions.
984 
985 “If you don’t live in Kensington Gardens now--”
986 
987 “Sometimes I do still.”
988 
989 “But where do you live mostly now?”
990 
991 “With the lost boys.”
992 
993 “Who are they?”
994 
995 “They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the
996 nurse is looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven
997 days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I’m
998 captain.”
999 
1000 “What fun it must be!”
1001 
1002 “Yes,” said cunning Peter, “but we are rather lonely. You see we have no
1003 female companionship.”
1004 
1005 “Are none of the others girls?”
1006 
1007 “Oh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of their
1008 prams.”
1009 
1010 This flattered Wendy immensely. “I think,” she said, “it is perfectly
1011 lovely the way you talk about girls; John there just despises us.”
1012 
1013 For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and all; one
1014 kick. This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she
1015 told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house. However,
1016 John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him
1017 to remain there. “And I know you meant to be kind,” she said, relenting,
1018 “so you may give me a kiss.”
1019 
1020 For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses. “I thought
1021 you would want it back,” he said a little bitterly, and offered to
1022 return her the thimble.
1023 
1024 “Oh dear,” said the nice Wendy, “I don’t mean a kiss, I mean a thimble.”
1025 
1026 “What’s that?”
1027 
1028 “It’s like this.” She kissed him.
1029 
1030 “Funny!” said Peter gravely. “Now shall I give you a thimble?”
1031 
1032 “If you wish to,” said Wendy, keeping her head erect this time.
1033 
1034 Peter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched. “What is it,
1035 Wendy?”
1036 
1037 “It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair.”
1038 
1039 “That must have been Tink. I never knew her so naughty before.”
1040 
1041 And indeed Tink was darting about again, using offensive language.
1042 
1043 “She says she will do that to you, Wendy, every time I give you a
1044 thimble.”
1045 
1046 “But why?”
1047 
1048 “Why, Tink?”
1049 
1050 Again Tink replied, “You silly ass.” Peter could not understand why,
1051 but Wendy understood, and she was just slightly disappointed when he
1052 admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen
1053 to stories.
1054 
1055 “You see, I don’t know any stories. None of the lost boys knows any
1056 stories.”
1057 
1058 “How perfectly awful,” Wendy said.
1059 
1060 “Do you know,” Peter asked “why swallows build in the eaves of houses?
1061 It is to listen to the stories. O Wendy, your mother was telling you
1062 such a lovely story.”
1063 
1064 “Which story was it?”
1065 
1066 “About the prince who couldn’t find the lady who wore the glass
1067 slipper.”
1068 
1069 “Peter,” said Wendy excitedly, “that was Cinderella, and he found her,
1070 and they lived happily ever after.”
1071 
1072 Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor, where they had been
1073 sitting, and hurried to the window.
1074 
1075 “Where are you going?” she cried with misgiving.
1076 
1077 “To tell the other boys.”
1078 
1079 “Don’t go Peter,” she entreated, “I know such lots of stories.”
1080 
1081 Those were her precise words, so there can be no denying that it was she
1082 who first tempted him.
1083 
1084 He came back, and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to
1085 have alarmed her, but did not.
1086 
1087 “Oh, the stories I could tell to the boys!” she cried, and then Peter
1088 gripped her and began to draw her toward the window.
1089 
1090 “Let me go!” she ordered him.
1091 
1092 “Wendy, do come with me and tell the other boys.”
1093 
1094 Of course she was very pleased to be asked, but she said, “Oh dear, I
1095 can’t. Think of mummy! Besides, I can’t fly.”
1096 
1097 “I’ll teach you.”
1098 
1099 “Oh, how lovely to fly.”
1100 
1101 “I’ll teach you how to jump on the wind’s back, and then away we go.”
1102 
1103 “Oo!” she exclaimed rapturously.
1104 
1105 “Wendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be
1106 flying about with me saying funny things to the stars.”
1107 
1108 “Oo!”
1109 
1110 “And, Wendy, there are mermaids.”
1111 
1112 “Mermaids! With tails?”
1113 
1114 “Such long tails.”
1115 
1116 “Oh,” cried Wendy, “to see a mermaid!”
1117 
1118 He had become frightfully cunning. “Wendy,” he said, “how we should all
1119 respect you.”
1120 
1121 She was wriggling her body in distress. It was quite as if she were
1122 trying to remain on the nursery floor.
1123 
1124 But he had no pity for her.
1125 
1126 “Wendy,” he said, the sly one, “you could tuck us in at night.”
1127 
1128 “Oo!”
1129 
1130 “None of us has ever been tucked in at night.”
1131 
1132 “Oo,” and her arms went out to him.
1133 
1134 “And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None of us has
1135 any pockets.”
1136 
1137 How could she resist. “Of course it’s awfully fascinating!” she cried.
1138 “Peter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?”
1139 
1140 “If you like,” he said indifferently, and she ran to John and Michael
1141 and shook them. “Wake up,” she cried, “Peter Pan has come and he is to
1142 teach us to fly.”
1143 
1144 John rubbed his eyes. “Then I shall get up,” he said. Of course he was
1145 on the floor already. “Hallo,” he said, “I am up!”
1146 
1147 Michael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six
1148 blades and a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence. Their faces assumed
1149 the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up
1150 world. All was as still as salt. Then everything was right. No, stop!
1151 Everything was wrong. Nana, who had been barking distressfully all the
1152 evening, was quiet now. It was her silence they had heard.
1153 
1154 “Out with the light! Hide! Quick!” cried John, taking command for the
1155 only time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when Liza entered,
1156 holding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and
1157 you would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing
1158 angelically as they slept. They were really doing it artfully from
1159 behind the window curtains.
1160 
1161 Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in
1162 the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her
1163 cheek, by Nana’s absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting
1164 a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in
1165 custody of course.
1166 
1167 “There, you suspicious brute,” she said, not sorry that Nana was in
1168 disgrace. “They are perfectly safe, aren’t they? Every one of the little
1169 angels sound asleep in bed. Listen to their gentle breathing.”
1170 
1171 Here Michael, encouraged by his success, breathed so loudly that they
1172 were nearly detected. Nana knew that kind of breathing, and she tried to
1173 drag herself out of Liza’s clutches.
1174 
1175 But Liza was dense. “No more of it, Nana,” she said sternly, pulling
1176 her out of the room. “I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight
1177 for master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then, oh,
1178 won’t master whip you, just.”
1179 
1180 She tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased to bark?
1181 Bring master and missus home from the party! Why, that was just what she
1182 wanted. Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her
1183 charges were safe? Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings, and
1184 Nana, seeing that no help would come from her, strained and strained at
1185 the chain until at last she broke it. In another moment she had burst
1186 into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven, her most
1187 expressive way of making a communication. Mr. and Mrs. Darling knew at
1188 once that something terrible was happening in their nursery, and without
1189 a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street.
1190 
1191 But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing
1192 behind the curtains, and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes.
1193 
1194 We now return to the nursery.
1195 
1196 “It’s all right,” John announced, emerging from his hiding-place. “I
1197 say, Peter, can you really fly?”
1198 
1199 Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room, taking
1200 the mantelpiece on the way.
1201 
1202 “How topping!” said John and Michael.
1203 
1204 “How sweet!” cried Wendy.
1205 
1206 “Yes, I’m sweet, oh, I am sweet!” said Peter, forgetting his manners
1207 again.
1208 
1209 It looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and
1210 then from the beds, but they always went down instead of up.
1211 
1212 “I say, how do you do it?” asked John, rubbing his knee. He was quite a
1213 practical boy.
1214 
1215 “You just think lovely wonderful thoughts,” Peter explained, “and they
1216 lift you up in the air.”
1217 
1218 He showed them again.
1219 
1220 “You’re so nippy at it,” John said, “couldn’t you do it very slowly
1221 once?”
1222 
1223 Peter did it both slowly and quickly. “I’ve got it now, Wendy!” cried
1224 John, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them could fly an inch,
1225 though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter did not
1226 know A from Z.
1227 
1228 Of course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless
1229 the fairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we have mentioned,
1230 one of his hands was messy with it, and he blew some on each of them,
1231 with the most superb results.
1232 
1233 “Now just wiggle your shoulders this way,” he said, “and let go.”
1234 
1235 They were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first. He did
1236 not quite mean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne
1237 across the room.
1238 
1239 “I flewed!” he screamed while still in mid-air.
1240 
1241 John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom.
1242 
1243 “Oh, lovely!”
1244 
1245 “Oh, ripping!”
1246 
1247 “Look at me!”
1248 
1249 “Look at me!”
1250 
1251 “Look at me!”
1252 
1253 They were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a
1254 little, but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is
1255 almost nothing so delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy a hand at first,
1256 but had to desist, Tink was so indignant.
1257 
1258 Up and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy’s word.
1259 
1260 “I say,” cried John, “why shouldn’t we all go out?”
1261 
1262 Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them.
1263 
1264 Michael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion
1265 miles. But Wendy hesitated.
1266 
1267 “Mermaids!” said Peter again.
1268 
1269 “Oo!”
1270 
1271 “And there are pirates.”
1272 
1273 “Pirates,” cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, “let us go at once.”
1274 
1275 It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana
1276 out of 27. They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the
1277 nursery window; and, yes, it was still shut, but the room was ablaze
1278 with light, and most heart-gripping sight of all, they could see in
1279 shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling
1280 round and round, not on the floor but in the air.
1281 
1282 Not three figures, four!
1283 
1284 In a tremble they opened the street door. Mr. Darling would have rushed
1285 upstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go softly. She even tried to
1286 make her heart go softly.
1287 
1288 Will they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them, and
1289 we shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story. On
1290 the other hand, if they are not in time, I solemnly promise that it will
1291 all come right in the end.
1292 
1293 They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the
1294 little stars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the window
1295 open, and that smallest star of all called out:
1296 
1297 “Cave, Peter!”
1298 
1299 Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose. “Come,” he cried
1300 imperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed by John and
1301 Michael and Wendy.
1302 
1303 Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late. The
1304 birds were flown.
1305 
1306 
1307 
1308 
1309 Chapter 4 THE FLIGHT
1310 
1311 “Second to the right, and straight on till morning.”
1312 
1313 That, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even
1314 birds, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not
1315 have sighted it with these instructions. Peter, you see, just said
1316 anything that came into his head.
1317 
1318 At first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the
1319 delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or
1320 any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy.
1321 
1322 John and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.
1323 
1324 They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought
1325 themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room.
1326 
1327 Not long ago. But how long ago? They were flying over the sea before
1328 this thought began to disturb Wendy seriously. John thought it was their
1329 second sea and their third night.
1330 
1331 Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold
1332 and again too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they
1333 merely pretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding
1334 them? His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable
1335 for humans and snatch it from them; then the birds would follow and
1336 snatch it back; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for
1337 miles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will. But Wendy
1338 noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this
1339 was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even that
1340 there are other ways.
1341 
1342 Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that
1343 was a danger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell. The awful
1344 thing was that Peter thought this funny.
1345 
1346 “There he goes again!” he would cry gleefully, as Michael suddenly
1347 dropped like a stone.
1348 
1349 “Save him, save him!” cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruel
1350 sea far below. Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch
1351 Michael just before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way
1352 he did it; but he always waited till the last moment, and you felt it
1353 was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life.
1354 Also he was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed him one moment
1355 would suddenly cease to engage him, so there was always the possibility
1356 that the next time you fell he would let you go.
1357 
1358 He could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back
1359 and floating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light
1360 that if you got behind him and blew he went faster.
1361 
1362 “Do be more polite to him,” Wendy whispered to John, when they were
1363 playing “Follow my Leader.”
1364 
1365 “Then tell him to stop showing off,” said John.
1366 
1367 When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and
1368 touch each shark’s tail in passing, just as in the street you may run
1369 your finger along an iron railing. They could not follow him in this
1370 with much success, so perhaps it was rather like showing off, especially
1371 as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed.
1372 
1373 “You must be nice to him,” Wendy impressed on her brothers. “What could
1374 we do if he were to leave us!”
1375 
1376 “We could go back,” Michael said.
1377 
1378 “How could we ever find our way back without him?”
1379 
1380 “Well, then, we could go on,” said John.
1381 
1382 “That is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for we don’t
1383 know how to stop.”
1384 
1385 This was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop.
1386 
1387 John said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was to
1388 go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must come
1389 back to their own window.
1390 
1391 “And who is to get food for us, John?”
1392 
1393 “I nipped a bit out of that eagle’s mouth pretty neatly, Wendy.”
1394 
1395 “After the twentieth try,” Wendy reminded him. “And even though we
1396 became good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds and things
1397 if he is not near to give us a hand.”
1398 
1399 Indeed they were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly, though
1400 they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front of
1401 them, the more they tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they bump
1402 into it. If Nana had been with them, she would have had a bandage round
1403 Michael’s forehead by this time.
1404 
1405 Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up
1406 there by themselves. He could go so much faster than they that he would
1407 suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no
1408 share. He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had
1409 been saying to a star, but he had already forgotten what it was, or he
1410 would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not be
1411 able to say for certain what had been happening. It was really rather
1412 irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid.
1413 
1414 “And if he forgets them so quickly,” Wendy argued, “how can we expect
1415 that he will go on remembering us?”
1416 
1417 Indeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least
1418 not well. Wendy was sure of it. She saw recognition come into his eyes
1419 as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on; once even she
1420 had to call him by name.
1421 
1422 “I’m Wendy,” she said agitatedly.
1423 
1424 He was very sorry. “I say, Wendy,” he whispered to her, “always if you
1425 see me forgetting you, just keep on saying ‘I’m Wendy,’ and then I’ll
1426 remember.”
1427 
1428 Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he
1429 showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their
1430 way, and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several
1431 times and found that they could sleep thus with security. Indeed they
1432 would have slept longer, but Peter tired quickly of sleeping, and soon
1433 he would cry in his captain voice, “We get off here.” So with occasional
1434 tiffs, but on the whole rollicking, they drew near the Neverland; for
1435 after many moons they did reach it, and, what is more, they had been
1436 going pretty straight all the time, not perhaps so much owing to the
1437 guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was looking for them. It
1438 is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores.
1439 
1440 “There it is,” said Peter calmly.
1441 
1442 “Where, where?”
1443 
1444 “Where all the arrows are pointing.”
1445 
1446 Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children, all
1447 directed by their friend the sun, who wanted them to be sure of their
1448 way before leaving them for the night.
1449 
1450 Wendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get their
1451 first sight of the island. Strange to say, they all recognized it at
1452 once, and until fear fell upon them they hailed it, not as something
1453 long dreamt of and seen at last, but as a familiar friend to whom they
1454 were returning home for the holidays.
1455 
1456 “John, there’s the lagoon.”
1457 
1458 “Wendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand.”
1459 
1460 “I say, John, I see your flamingo with the broken leg!”
1461 
1462 “Look, Michael, there’s your cave!”
1463 
1464 “John, what’s that in the brushwood?”
1465 
1466 “It’s a wolf with her whelps. Wendy, I do believe that’s your little
1467 whelp!”
1468 
1469 “There’s my boat, John, with her sides stove in!”
1470 
1471 “No, it isn’t. Why, we burned your boat.”
1472 
1473 “That’s her, at any rate. I say, John, I see the smoke of the redskin
1474 camp!”
1475 
1476 “Where? Show me, and I’ll tell you by the way smoke curls whether they
1477 are on the war-path.”
1478 
1479 “There, just across the Mysterious River.”
1480 
1481 “I see now. Yes, they are on the war-path right enough.”
1482 
1483 Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much, but if he
1484 wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand, for have I not told
1485 you that anon fear fell upon them?
1486 
1487 It came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom.
1488 
1489 In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little
1490 dark and threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches arose in it
1491 and spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts of
1492 prey was quite different now, and above all, you lost the certainty that
1493 you would win. You were quite glad that the night-lights were on. You
1494 even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here, and
1495 that the Neverland was all make-believe.
1496 
1497 Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it
1498 was real now, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker
1499 every moment, and where was Nana?
1500 
1501 They had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now. His
1502 careless manner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle
1503 went through them every time they touched his body. They were now over
1504 the fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their
1505 feet. Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had
1506 become slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way
1507 through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had
1508 beaten on it with his fists.
1509 
1510 “They don’t want us to land,” he explained.
1511 
1512 “Who are they?” Wendy whispered, shuddering.
1513 
1514 But he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his
1515 shoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in front.
1516 
1517 Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his
1518 hand to his ear, and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that
1519 they seemed to bore two holes to earth. Having done these things, he
1520 went on again.
1521 
1522 His courage was almost appalling. “Would you like an adventure now,” he
1523 said casually to John, “or would you like to have your tea first?”
1524 
1525 Wendy said “tea first” quickly, and Michael pressed her hand in
1526 gratitude, but the braver John hesitated.
1527 
1528 “What kind of adventure?” he asked cautiously.
1529 
1530 “There’s a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us,” Peter told him.
1531 “If you like, we’ll go down and kill him.”
1532 
1533 “I don’t see him,” John said after a long pause.
1534 
1535 “I do.”
1536 
1537 “Suppose,” John said, a little huskily, “he were to wake up.”
1538 
1539 Peter spoke indignantly. “You don’t think I would kill him while he was
1540 sleeping! I would wake him first, and then kill him. That’s the way I
1541 always do.”
1542 
1543 “I say! Do you kill many?”
1544 
1545 “Tons.”
1546 
1547 John said “How ripping,” but decided to have tea first. He asked if
1548 there were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said he had
1549 never known so many.
1550 
1551 “Who is captain now?”
1552 
1553 “Hook,” answered Peter, and his face became very stern as he said that
1554 hated word.
1555 
1556 “Jas. Hook?”
1557 
1558 “Ay.”
1559 
1560 Then indeed Michael began to cry, and even John could speak in gulps
1561 only, for they knew Hook’s reputation.
1562 
1563 “He was Blackbeard’s bo’sun,” John whispered huskily. “He is the worst
1564 of them all. He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid.”
1565 
1566 “That’s him,” said Peter.
1567 
1568 “What is he like? Is he big?”
1569 
1570 “He is not so big as he was.”
1571 
1572 “How do you mean?”
1573 
1574 “I cut off a bit of him.”
1575 
1576 “You!”
1577 
1578 “Yes, me,” said Peter sharply.
1579 
1580 “I wasn’t meaning to be disrespectful.”
1581 
1582 “Oh, all right.”
1583 
1584 “But, I say, what bit?”
1585 
1586 “His right hand.”
1587 
1588 “Then he can’t fight now?”
1589 
1590 “Oh, can’t he just!”
1591 
1592 “Left-hander?”
1593 
1594 “He has an iron hook instead of a right hand, and he claws with it.”
1595 
1596 “Claws!”
1597 
1598 “I say, John,” said Peter.
1599 
1600 “Yes.”
1601 
1602 “Say, ‘Ay, ay, sir.’”
1603 
1604 “Ay, ay, sir.”
1605 
1606 “There is one thing,” Peter continued, “that every boy who serves under
1607 me has to promise, and so must you.”
1608 
1609 John paled.
1610 
1611 “It is this, if we meet Hook in open fight, you must leave him to me.”
1612 
1613 “I promise,” John said loyally.
1614 
1615 For the moment they were feeling less eerie, because Tink was flying
1616 with them, and in her light they could distinguish each other.
1617 Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they, and so she had to go
1618 round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo. Wendy
1619 quite liked it, until Peter pointed out the drawbacks.
1620 
1621 “She tells me,” he said, “that the pirates sighted us before the
1622 darkness came, and got Long Tom out.”
1623 
1624 “The big gun?”
1625 
1626 “Yes. And of course they must see her light, and if they guess we are
1627 near it they are sure to let fly.”
1628 
1629 “Wendy!”
1630 
1631 “John!”
1632 
1633 “Michael!”
1634 
1635 “Tell her to go away at once, Peter,” the three cried simultaneously,
1636 but he refused.
1637 
1638 “She thinks we have lost the way,” he replied stiffly, “and she is
1639 rather frightened. You don’t think I would send her away all by herself
1640 when she is frightened!”
1641 
1642 For a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave Peter a
1643 loving little pinch.
1644 
1645 “Then tell her,” Wendy begged, “to put out her light.”
1646 
1647 “She can’t put it out. That is about the only thing fairies can’t do. It
1648 just goes out of itself when she falls asleep, same as the stars.”
1649 
1650 “Then tell her to sleep at once,” John almost ordered.
1651 
1652 “She can’t sleep except when she’s sleepy. It is the only other thing
1653 fairies can’t do.”
1654 
1655 “Seems to me,” growled John, “these are the only two things worth
1656 doing.”
1657 
1658 Here he got a pinch, but not a loving one.
1659 
1660 “If only one of us had a pocket,” Peter said, “we could carry her in
1661 it.” However, they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a
1662 pocket between the four of them.
1663 
1664 He had a happy idea. John’s hat!
1665 
1666 Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John carried
1667 it, though she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently Wendy took
1668 the hat, because John said it struck against his knee as he flew; and
1669 this, as we shall see, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated to be
1670 under an obligation to Wendy.
1671 
1672 In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on in
1673 silence. It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken once by
1674 a distant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at
1675 the ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches
1676 of trees rubbing together, but he said it was the redskins sharpening
1677 their knives.
1678 
1679 Even these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful. “If
1680 only something would make a sound!” he cried.
1681 
1682 As if in answer to his request, the air was rent by the most tremendous
1683 crash he had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom at them.
1684 
1685 The roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to
1686 cry savagely, “Where are they, where are they, where are they?”
1687 
1688 Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an
1689 island of make-believe and the same island come true.
1690 
1691 When at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael
1692 found themselves alone in the darkness. John was treading the air
1693 mechanically, and Michael without knowing how to float was floating.
1694 
1695 “Are you shot?” John whispered tremulously.
1696 
1697 “I haven’t tried [myself out] yet,” Michael whispered back.
1698 
1699 We know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried
1700 by the wind of the shot far out to sea, while Wendy was blown upwards
1701 with no companion but Tinker Bell.
1702 
1703 It would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had dropped the
1704 hat.
1705 
1706 I don’t know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether she had
1707 planned it on the way, but she at once popped out of the hat and began
1708 to lure Wendy to her destruction.
1709 
1710 Tink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but, on the
1711 other hand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or
1712 the other, because being so small they unfortunately have room for one
1713 feeling only at a time. They are, however, allowed to change, only it
1714 must be a complete change. At present she was full of jealousy of Wendy.
1715 What she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could not of course understand,
1716 and I believe some of it was bad words, but it sounded kind, and she
1717 flew back and forward, plainly meaning “Follow me, and all will be
1718 well.”
1719 
1720 What else could poor Wendy do? She called to Peter and John and Michael,
1721 and got only mocking echoes in reply. She did not yet know that Tink
1722 hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman. And so, bewildered,
1723 and now staggering in her flight, she followed Tink to her doom.
1724 
1725 
1726 
1727 
1728 Chapter 5 THE ISLAND COME TRUE
1729 
1730 Feeling that Peter was on his way back, the Neverland had again woke
1731 into life. We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is
1732 better and was always used by Peter.
1733 
1734 In his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take
1735 an hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the
1736 redskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and
1737 lost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other. But with the
1738 coming of Peter, who hates lethargy, they are under way again: if you
1739 put your ear to the ground now, you would hear the whole island seething
1740 with life.
1741 
1742 On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows.
1743 The lost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out looking
1744 for the lost boys, the redskins were out looking for the pirates, and
1745 the beasts were out looking for the redskins. They were going round and
1746 round the island, but they did not meet because all were going at the
1747 same rate.
1748 
1749 All wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but to-night
1750 were out to greet their captain. The boys on the island vary, of course,
1751 in numbers, according as they get killed and so on; and when they seem
1752 to be growing up, which is against the rules, Peter thins them out; but
1753 at this time there were six of them, counting the twins as two. Let us
1754 pretend to lie here among the sugar-cane and watch them as they steal by
1755 in single file, each with his hand on his dagger.
1756 
1757 They are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him, and they wear
1758 the skins of the bears slain by themselves, in which they are so round
1759 and furry that when they fall they roll. They have therefore become very
1760 sure-footed.
1761 
1762 The first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most
1763 unfortunate of all that gallant band. He had been in fewer adventures
1764 than any of them, because the big things constantly happened just when
1765 he had stepped round the corner; all would be quiet, he would take the
1766 opportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood, and
1767 then when he returned the others would be sweeping up the blood. This
1768 ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to his countenance, but instead
1769 of souring his nature had sweetened it, so that he was quite the
1770 humblest of the boys. Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the air for
1771 you to-night. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if
1772 accepted, will plunge you in deepest woe. Tootles, the fairy Tink, who
1773 is bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool [for doing her
1774 mischief], and she thinks you are the most easily tricked of the boys.
1775 ‘Ware Tinker Bell.
1776 
1777 Would that he could hear us, but we are not really on the island, and he
1778 passes by, biting his knuckles.
1779 
1780 Next comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who cuts
1781 whistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes.
1782 Slightly is the most conceited of the boys. He thinks he remembers the
1783 days before he was lost, with their manners and customs, and this has
1784 given his nose an offensive tilt. Curly is fourth; he is a pickle, [a
1785 person who gets in pickles-predicaments] and so often has he had to
1786 deliver up his person when Peter said sternly, “Stand forth the one who
1787 did this thing,” that now at the command he stands forth automatically
1788 whether he has done it or not. Last come the Twins, who cannot be
1789 described because we should be sure to be describing the wrong one.
1790 Peter never quite knew what twins were, and his band were not allowed
1791 to know anything he did not know, so these two were always vague about
1792 themselves, and did their best to give satisfaction by keeping close
1793 together in an apologetic sort of way.
1794 
1795 The boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause,
1796 for things go briskly on the island, come the pirates on their track. We
1797 hear them before they are seen, and it is always the same dreadful song:
1798 
1799      “Avast belay, yo ho, heave to,
1800      A-pirating we go,
1801      And if we’re parted by a shot
1802      We’re sure to meet below!”
1803 
1804 A more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock.
1805 Here, a little in advance, ever and again with his head to the
1806 ground listening, his great arms bare, pieces of eight in his ears as
1807 ornaments, is the handsome Italian Cecco, who cut his name in letters
1808 of blood on the back of the governor of the prison at Gao. That gigantic
1809 black behind him has had many names since he dropped the one with
1810 which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the banks of the
1811 Guadjo-mo. Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him tattooed, the same Bill
1812 Jukes who got six dozen on the WALRUS from Flint before he would drop
1813 the bag of moidores [Portuguese gold pieces]; and Cookson, said to
1814 be Black Murphy’s brother (but this was never proved), and Gentleman
1815 Starkey, once an usher in a public school and still dainty in his ways
1816 of killing; and Skylights (Morgan’s Skylights); and the Irish bo’sun
1817 Smee, an oddly genial man who stabbed, so to speak, without offence,
1818 and was the only Non-conformist in Hook’s crew; and Noodler, whose
1819 hands were fixed on backwards; and Robt. Mullins and Alf Mason and many
1820 another ruffian long known and feared on the Spanish Main.
1821 
1822 In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting,
1823 reclined James Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is
1824 said he was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared. He lay at his ease in
1825 a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his men, and instead of a right
1826 hand he had the iron hook with which ever and anon he encouraged them
1827 to increase their pace. As dogs this terrible man treated and addressed
1828 them, and as dogs they obeyed him. In person he was cadaverous [dead
1829 looking] and blackavized [dark faced], and his hair was dressed in long
1830 curls, which at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a
1831 singularly threatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes
1832 were of the blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy,
1833 save when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red spots
1834 appeared in them and lit them up horribly. In manner, something of the
1835 grand seigneur still clung to him, so that he even ripped you up with
1836 an air, and I have been told that he was a RACONTEUR [storyteller] of
1837 repute. He was never more sinister than when he was most polite,
1838 which is probably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of his
1839 diction, even when he was swearing, no less than the distinction of his
1840 demeanour, showed him one of a different cast from his crew. A man of
1841 indomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was
1842 the sight of his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour.
1843 In dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles
1844 II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he
1845 bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his mouth
1846 he had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke two
1847 cigars at once. But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron
1848 claw.
1849 
1850 Let us now kill a pirate, to show Hook’s method. Skylights will do. As
1851 they pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling his lace
1852 collar; the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one screech,
1853 then the body is kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. He has not even
1854 taken the cigars from his mouth.
1855 
1856 Such is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted. Which will
1857 win?
1858 
1859 On the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war-path,
1860 which is not visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every one
1861 of them with his eyes peeled. They carry tomahawks and knives, and their
1862 naked bodies gleam with paint and oil. Strung around them are scalps, of
1863 boys as well as of pirates, for these are the Piccaninny tribe, and not
1864 to be confused with the softer-hearted Delawares or the Hurons. In
1865 the van, on all fours, is Great Big Little Panther, a brave of so many
1866 scalps that in his present position they somewhat impede his progress.
1867 Bringing up the rear, the place of greatest danger, comes Tiger Lily,
1868 proudly erect, a princess in her own right. She is the most beautiful
1869 of dusky Dianas [Diana = goddess of the woods] and the belle of the
1870 Piccaninnies, coquettish [flirting], cold and amorous [loving] by turns;
1871 there is not a brave who would not have the wayward thing to wife, but
1872 she staves off the altar with a hatchet. Observe how they pass over
1873 fallen twigs without making the slightest noise. The only sound to be
1874 heard is their somewhat heavy breathing. The fact is that they are all a
1875 little fat just now after the heavy gorging, but in time they will work
1876 this off. For the moment, however, it constitutes their chief danger.
1877 
1878 The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their
1879 place is taken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions,
1880 tigers, bears, and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee
1881 from them, for every kind of beast, and, more particularly, all the
1882 man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the favoured island. Their tongues are
1883 hanging out, they are hungry to-night.
1884 
1885 When they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic
1886 crocodile. We shall see for whom she is looking presently.
1887 
1888 The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the procession
1889 must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its
1890 pace. Then quickly they will be on top of each other.
1891 
1892 All are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the
1893 danger may be creeping up from behind. This shows how real the island
1894 was.
1895 
1896 The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. They flung
1897 themselves down on the sward [turf], close to their underground home.
1898 
1899 “I do wish Peter would come back,” every one of them said nervously,
1900 though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than
1901 their captain.
1902 
1903 “I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,” Slightly said, in
1904 the tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but perhaps some
1905 distant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, “but I wish he
1906 would come back, and tell us whether he has heard anything more about
1907 Cinderella.”
1908 
1909 They talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his mother
1910 must have been very like her.
1911 
1912 It was only in Peter’s absence that they could speak of mothers, the
1913 subject being forbidden by him as silly.
1914 
1915 “All I remember about my mother,” Nibs told them, “is that she often
1916 said to my father, ‘Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own!’ I
1917 don’t know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love to give my
1918 mother one.”
1919 
1920 While they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not being wild
1921 things of the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and it
1922 was the grim song:
1923 
1924      “Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,
1925      The flag o’ skull and bones,
1926      A merry hour, a hempen rope,
1927      And hey for Davy Jones.”
1928 
1929 At once the lost boys--but where are they? They are no longer there.
1930 Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.
1931 
1932 I will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who has
1933 darted away to reconnoitre [look around], they are already in their home
1934 under the ground, a very delightful residence of which we shall see
1935 a good deal presently. But how have they reached it? for there is no
1936 entrance to be seen, not so much as a large stone, which if rolled away,
1937 would disclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely, however, and you may
1938 note that there are here seven large trees, each with a hole in its
1939 hollow trunk as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances to the
1940 home under the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these
1941 many moons. Will he find it tonight?
1942 
1943 As the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs
1944 disappearing through the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out. But
1945 an iron claw gripped his shoulder.
1946 
1947 “Captain, let go!” he cried, writhing.
1948 
1949 Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black voice.
1950 “Put back that pistol first,” it said threateningly.
1951 
1952 “It was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him dead.”
1953 
1954 “Ay, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily’s redskins upon us. Do
1955 you want to lose your scalp?”
1956 
1957 “Shall I after him, Captain,” asked pathetic Smee, “and tickle him
1958 with Johnny Corkscrew?” Smee had pleasant names for everything, and his
1959 cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in the wound. One
1960 could mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance, after killing,
1961 it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon.
1962 
1963 “Johnny’s a silent fellow,” he reminded Hook.
1964 
1965 “Not now, Smee,” Hook said darkly. “He is only one, and I want to
1966 mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them.”
1967 
1968 The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain
1969 and Smee were alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it
1970 was, perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening, but there
1971 came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo’sun the story of
1972 his life. He spoke long and earnestly, but what it was all about Smee,
1973 who was rather stupid, did not know in the least.
1974 
1975 Anon [later] he caught the word Peter.
1976 
1977 “Most of all,” Hook was saying passionately, “I want their captain,
1978 Peter Pan. ‘Twas he cut off my arm.” He brandished the hook
1979 threateningly. “I’ve waited long to shake his hand with this. Oh, I’ll
1980 tear him!”
1981 
1982 “And yet,” said Smee, “I have often heard you say that hook was worth a
1983 score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses.”
1984 
1985 “Ay,” the captain answered, “if I was a mother I would pray to have my
1986 children born with this instead of that,” and he cast a look of pride
1987 upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other. Then again he
1988 frowned.
1989 
1990 “Peter flung my arm,” he said, wincing, “to a crocodile that happened to
1991 be passing by.”
1992 
1993 “I have often,” said Smee, “noticed your strange dread of crocodiles.”
1994 
1995 “Not of crocodiles,” Hook corrected him, “but of that one crocodile.” He
1996 lowered his voice. “It liked my arm so much, Smee, that it has followed
1997 me ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land, licking its lips
1998 for the rest of me.”
1999 
2000 “In a way,” said Smee, “it’s sort of a compliment.”
2001 
2002 “I want no such compliments,” Hook barked petulantly. “I want Peter Pan,
2003 who first gave the brute its taste for me.”
2004 
2005 He sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in his
2006 voice. “Smee,” he said huskily, “that crocodile would have had me before
2007 this, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick
2008 inside it, and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt.” He
2009 laughed, but in a hollow way.
2010 
2011 “Some day,” said Smee, “the clock will run down, and then he’ll get
2012 you.”
2013 
2014 Hook wetted his dry lips. “Ay,” he said, “that’s the fear that haunts
2015 me.”
2016 
2017 Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm. “Smee,” he said, “this
2018 seat is hot.” He jumped up. “Odds bobs, hammer and tongs I’m burning.”
2019 
2020 They examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown
2021 on the mainland; they tried to pull it up, and it came away at once in
2022 their hands, for it had no root. Stranger still, smoke began at once
2023 to ascend. The pirates looked at each other. “A chimney!” they both
2024 exclaimed.
2025 
2026 They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. It
2027 was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were
2028 in the neighbourhood.
2029 
2030 Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children’s voices, for
2031 so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily
2032 chattering. The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom.
2033 They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees.
2034 
2035 “Did you hear them say Peter Pan’s from home?” Smee whispered, fidgeting
2036 with Johnny Corkscrew.
2037 
2038 Hook nodded. He stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a
2039 curdling smile lit up his swarthy face. Smee had been waiting for it.
2040 “Unrip your plan, captain,” he cried eagerly.
2041 
2042 “To return to the ship,” Hook replied slowly through his teeth, “and
2043 cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it.
2044 There can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The silly
2045 moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece.
2046 That shows they have no mother. We will leave the cake on the shore
2047 of the Mermaids’ Lagoon. These boys are always swimming about there,
2048 playing with the mermaids. They will find the cake and they will gobble
2049 it up, because, having no mother, they don’t know how dangerous ‘tis to
2050 eat rich damp cake.” He burst into laughter, not hollow laughter now,
2051 but honest laughter. “Aha, they will die.”
2052 
2053 Smee had listened with growing admiration.
2054 
2055 “It’s the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!” he cried, and in
2056 their exultation they danced and sang:
2057 
2058      “Avast, belay, when I appear,
2059      By fear they’re overtook;
2060      Nought’s left upon your bones when you
2061      Have shaken claws with Hook.”
2062 
2063 They began the verse, but they never finished it, for another sound
2064 broke in and stilled them. There was at first such a tiny sound that a
2065 leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it, but as it came nearer it
2066 was more distinct.
2067 
2068 Tick tick tick tick!
2069 
2070 Hook stood shuddering, one foot in the air.
2071 
2072 “The crocodile!” he gasped, and bounded away, followed by his bo’sun.
2073 
2074 It was indeed the crocodile. It had passed the redskins, who were now on
2075 the trail of the other pirates. It oozed on after Hook.
2076 
2077 Once more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the night
2078 were not yet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their
2079 midst, pursued by a pack of wolves. The tongues of the pursuers were
2080 hanging out; the baying of them was horrible.
2081 
2082 “Save me, save me!” cried Nibs, falling on the ground.
2083 
2084 “But what can we do, what can we do?”
2085 
2086 It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their
2087 thoughts turned to him.
2088 
2089 “What would Peter do?” they cried simultaneously.
2090 
2091 Almost in the same breath they cried, “Peter would look at them through
2092 his legs.”
2093 
2094 And then, “Let us do what Peter would do.”
2095 
2096 It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as one boy
2097 they bent and looked through their legs. The next moment is the long
2098 one, but victory came quickly, for as the boys advanced upon them in the
2099 terrible attitude, the wolves dropped their tails and fled.
2100 
2101 Now Nibs rose from the ground, and the others thought that his staring
2102 eyes still saw the wolves. But it was not wolves he saw.
2103 
2104 “I have seen a wonderfuller thing,” he cried, as they gathered round him
2105 eagerly. “A great white bird. It is flying this way.”
2106 
2107 “What kind of a bird, do you think?”
2108 
2109 “I don’t know,” Nibs said, awestruck, “but it looks so weary, and as it
2110 flies it moans, ‘Poor Wendy.’”
2111 
2112 “Poor Wendy?”
2113 
2114 “I remember,” said Slightly instantly, “there are birds called Wendies.”
2115 
2116 “See, it comes!” cried Curly, pointing to Wendy in the heavens.
2117 
2118 Wendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear her plaintive cry.
2119 But more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell. The jealous
2120 fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship, and was darting
2121 at her victim from every direction, pinching savagely each time she
2122 touched.
2123 
2124 “Hullo, Tink,” cried the wondering boys.
2125 
2126 Tink’s reply rang out: “Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy.”
2127 
2128 It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered. “Let us do
2129 what Peter wishes!” cried the simple boys. “Quick, bows and arrows!”
2130 
2131 All but Tootles popped down their trees. He had a bow and arrow with
2132 him, and Tink noted it, and rubbed her little hands.
2133 
2134 “Quick, Tootles, quick,” she screamed. “Peter will be so pleased.”
2135 
2136 Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow. “Out of the way, Tink,”
2137  he shouted, and then he fired, and Wendy fluttered to the ground with an
2138 arrow in her breast.
2139 
2140 
2141 
2142 
2143 Chapter 6 THE LITTLE HOUSE
2144 
2145 Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy’s body when the
2146 other boys sprang, armed, from their trees.
2147 
2148 “You are too late,” he cried proudly, “I have shot the Wendy. Peter will
2149 be so pleased with me.”
2150 
2151 Overhead Tinker Bell shouted “Silly ass!” and darted into hiding. The
2152 others did not hear her. They had crowded round Wendy, and as they
2153 looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood. If Wendy’s heart had been
2154 beating they would all have heard it.
2155 
2156 Slightly was the first to speak. “This is no bird,” he said in a scared
2157 voice. “I think this must be a lady.”
2158 
2159 “A lady?” said Tootles, and fell a-trembling.
2160 
2161 “And we have killed her,” Nibs said hoarsely.
2162 
2163 They all whipped off their caps.
2164 
2165 “Now I see,” Curly said: “Peter was bringing her to us.” He threw
2166 himself sorrowfully on the ground.
2167 
2168 “A lady to take care of us at last,” said one of the twins, “and you
2169 have killed her!”
2170 
2171 They were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when he took a
2172 step nearer them they turned from him.
2173 
2174 Tootles’ face was very white, but there was a dignity about him now that
2175 had never been there before.
2176 
2177 “I did it,” he said, reflecting. “When ladies used to come to me in
2178 dreams, I said, ‘Pretty mother, pretty mother.’ But when at last she
2179 really came, I shot her.”
2180 
2181 He moved slowly away.
2182 
2183 “Don’t go,” they called in pity.
2184 
2185 “I must,” he answered, shaking; “I am so afraid of Peter.”
2186 
2187 It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the
2188 heart of every one of them rise to his mouth. They heard Peter crow.
2189 
2190 “Peter!” they cried, for it was always thus that he signalled his
2191 return.
2192 
2193 “Hide her,” they whispered, and gathered hastily around Wendy. But
2194 Tootles stood aloof.
2195 
2196 Again came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of them.
2197 “Greetings, boys,” he cried, and mechanically they saluted, and then
2198 again was silence.
2199 
2200 He frowned.
2201 
2202 “I am back,” he said hotly, “why do you not cheer?”
2203 
2204 They opened their mouths, but the cheers would not come. He overlooked
2205 it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings.
2206 
2207 “Great news, boys,” he cried, “I have brought at last a mother for you
2208 all.”
2209 
2210 Still no sound, except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his
2211 knees.
2212 
2213 “Have you not seen her?” asked Peter, becoming troubled. “She flew this
2214 way.”
2215 
2216 “Ah me!” one voice said, and another said, “Oh, mournful day.”
2217 
2218 Tootles rose. “Peter,” he said quietly, “I will show her to you,” and
2219 when the others would still have hidden her he said, “Back, twins, let
2220 Peter see.”
2221 
2222 So they all stood back, and let him see, and after he had looked for a
2223 little time he did not know what to do next.
2224 
2225 “She is dead,” he said uncomfortably. “Perhaps she is frightened at
2226 being dead.”
2227 
2228 He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of
2229 sight of her, and then never going near the spot any more. They would
2230 all have been glad to follow if he had done this.
2231 
2232 But there was the arrow. He took it from her heart and faced his band.
2233 
2234 “Whose arrow?” he demanded sternly.
2235 
2236 “Mine, Peter,” said Tootles on his knees.
2237 
2238 “Oh, dastard hand,” Peter said, and he raised the arrow to use it as a
2239 dagger.
2240 
2241 Tootles did not flinch. He bared his breast. “Strike, Peter,” he said
2242 firmly, “strike true.”
2243 
2244 Twice did Peter raise the arrow, and twice did his hand fall. “I cannot
2245 strike,” he said with awe, “there is something stays my hand.”
2246 
2247 All looked at him in wonder, save Nibs, who fortunately looked at Wendy.
2248 
2249 “It is she,” he cried, “the Wendy lady, see, her arm!”
2250 
2251 Wonderful to relate [tell], Wendy had raised her arm. Nibs bent over
2252 her and listened reverently. “I think she said, ‘Poor Tootles,’” he
2253 whispered.
2254 
2255 “She lives,” Peter said briefly.
2256 
2257 Slightly cried instantly, “The Wendy lady lives.”
2258 
2259 Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button. You remember she had
2260 put it on a chain that she wore round her neck.
2261 
2262 “See,” he said, “the arrow struck against this. It is the kiss I gave
2263 her. It has saved her life.”
2264 
2265 “I remember kisses,” Slightly interposed quickly, “let me see it. Ay,
2266 that’s a kiss.”
2267 
2268 Peter did not hear him. He was begging Wendy to get better quickly, so
2269 that he could show her the mermaids. Of course she could not answer yet,
2270 being still in a frightful faint; but from overhead came a wailing note.
2271 
2272 “Listen to Tink,” said Curly, “she is crying because the Wendy lives.”
2273 
2274 Then they had to tell Peter of Tink’s crime, and almost never had they
2275 seen him look so stern.
2276 
2277 “Listen, Tinker Bell,” he cried, “I am your friend no more. Begone from
2278 me for ever.”
2279 
2280 She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded, but he brushed her off. Not
2281 until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say,
2282 “Well, not for ever, but for a whole week.”
2283 
2284 Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm? Oh
2285 dear no, never wanted to pinch her so much. Fairies indeed are strange,
2286 and Peter, who understood them best, often cuffed [slapped] them.
2287 
2288 But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health?
2289 
2290 “Let us carry her down into the house,” Curly suggested.
2291 
2292 “Ay,” said Slightly, “that is what one does with ladies.”
2293 
2294 “No, no,” Peter said, “you must not touch her. It would not be
2295 sufficiently respectful.”
2296 
2297 “That,” said Slightly, “is what I was thinking.”
2298 
2299 “But if she lies there,” Tootles said, “she will die.”
2300 
2301 “Ay, she will die,” Slightly admitted, “but there is no way out.”
2302 
2303 “Yes, there is,” cried Peter. “Let us build a little house round her.”
2304 
2305 They were all delighted. “Quick,” he ordered them, “bring me each of you
2306 the best of what we have. Gut our house. Be sharp.”
2307 
2308 In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding.
2309 They skurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for firewood, and
2310 while they were at it, who should appear but John and Michael. As they
2311 dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing, stopped, woke up,
2312 moved another step and slept again.
2313 
2314 “John, John,” Michael would cry, “wake up! Where is Nana, John, and
2315 mother?”
2316 
2317 And then John would rub his eyes and mutter, “It is true, we did fly.”
2318 
2319 You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter.
2320 
2321 “Hullo, Peter,” they said.
2322 
2323 “Hullo,” replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgotten them.
2324 He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see
2325 how large a house she would need. Of course he meant to leave room for
2326 chairs and a table. John and Michael watched him.
2327 
2328 “Is Wendy asleep?” they asked.
2329 
2330 “Yes.”
2331 
2332 “John,” Michael proposed, “let us wake her and get her to make supper
2333 for us,” but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying
2334 branches for the building of the house. “Look at them!” he cried.
2335 
2336 “Curly,” said Peter in his most captainy voice, “see that these boys
2337 help in the building of the house.”
2338 
2339 “Ay, ay, sir.”
2340 
2341 “Build a house?” exclaimed John.
2342 
2343 “For the Wendy,” said Curly.
2344 
2345 “For Wendy?” John said, aghast. “Why, she is only a girl!”
2346 
2347 “That,” explained Curly, “is why we are her servants.”
2348 
2349 “You? Wendy’s servants!”
2350 
2351 “Yes,” said Peter, “and you also. Away with them.”
2352 
2353 The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry.
2354 “Chairs and a fender [fireplace] first,” Peter ordered. “Then we shall
2355 build a house round them.”
2356 
2357 “Ay,” said Slightly, “that is how a house is built; it all comes back to
2358 me.”
2359 
2360 Peter thought of everything. “Slightly,” he cried, “fetch a doctor.”
2361 
2362 “Ay, ay,” said Slightly at once, and disappeared, scratching his head.
2363 But he knew Peter must be obeyed, and he returned in a moment, wearing
2364 John’s hat and looking solemn.
2365 
2366 “Please, sir,” said Peter, going to him, “are you a doctor?”
2367 
2368 The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that
2369 they knew it was make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were
2370 exactly the same thing. This sometimes troubled them, as when they had
2371 to make-believe that they had had their dinners.
2372 
2373 If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles.
2374 
2375 “Yes, my little man,” Slightly anxiously replied, who had chapped
2376 knuckles.
2377 
2378 “Please, sir,” Peter explained, “a lady lies very ill.”
2379 
2380 She was lying at their feet, but Slightly had the sense not to see her.
2381 
2382 “Tut, tut, tut,” he said, “where does she lie?”
2383 
2384 “In yonder glade.”
2385 
2386 “I will put a glass thing in her mouth,” said Slightly, and he
2387 made-believe to do it, while Peter waited. It was an anxious moment when
2388 the glass thing was withdrawn.
2389 
2390 “How is she?” inquired Peter.
2391 
2392 “Tut, tut, tut,” said Slightly, “this has cured her.”
2393 
2394 “I am glad!” Peter cried.
2395 
2396 “I will call again in the evening,” Slightly said; “give her beef tea
2397 out of a cup with a spout to it;” but after he had returned the hat
2398 to John he blew big breaths, which was his habit on escaping from a
2399 difficulty.
2400 
2401 In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes; almost
2402 everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy’s feet.
2403 
2404 “If only we knew,” said one, “the kind of house she likes best.”
2405 
2406 “Peter,” shouted another, “she is moving in her sleep.”
2407 
2408 “Her mouth opens,” cried a third, looking respectfully into it. “Oh,
2409 lovely!”
2410 
2411 “Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep,” said Peter. “Wendy, sing
2412 the kind of house you would like to have.”
2413 
2414 Immediately, without opening her eyes, Wendy began to sing:
2415 
2416      “I wish I had a pretty house,
2417      The littlest ever seen,
2418      With funny little red walls
2419      And roof of mossy green.”
2420 
2421 They gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the
2422 branches they had brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground
2423 was carpeted with moss. As they rattled up the little house they broke
2424 into song themselves:
2425 
2426      “We’ve built the little walls and roof
2427      And made a lovely door,
2428      So tell us, mother Wendy,
2429      What are you wanting more?”
2430 
2431 To this she answered greedily:
2432 
2433      “Oh, really next I think I’ll have
2434      Gay windows all about,
2435      With roses peeping in, you know,
2436      And babies peeping out.”
2437 
2438 With a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow leaves
2439 were the blinds. But roses--?
2440 
2441 “Roses,” cried Peter sternly.
2442 
2443 Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls.
2444 
2445 Babies?
2446 
2447 To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again:
2448 
2449      “We’ve made the roses peeping out,
2450      The babes are at the door,
2451      We cannot make ourselves, you know,
2452      ‘cos we’ve been made before.”
2453 
2454 Peter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it was his
2455 own. The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy
2456 within, though, of course, they could no longer see her. Peter strode
2457 up and down, ordering finishing touches. Nothing escaped his eagle eyes.
2458 Just when it seemed absolutely finished:
2459 
2460 “There’s no knocker on the door,” he said.
2461 
2462 They were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe, and it
2463 made an excellent knocker.
2464 
2465 Absolutely finished now, they thought.
2466 
2467 Not of bit of it. “There’s no chimney,” Peter said; “we must have a
2468 chimney.”
2469 
2470 “It certainly does need a chimney,” said John importantly. This gave
2471 Peter an idea. He snatched the hat off John’s head, knocked out the
2472 bottom [top], and put the hat on the roof. The little house was so
2473 pleased to have such a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you,
2474 smoke immediately began to come out of the hat.
2475 
2476 Now really and truly it was finished. Nothing remained to do but to
2477 knock.
2478 
2479 “All look your best,” Peter warned them; “first impressions are awfully
2480 important.”
2481 
2482 He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are; they were all
2483 too busy looking their best.
2484 
2485 He knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not
2486 a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was watching from a
2487 branch and openly sneering.
2488 
2489 What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock? If a
2490 lady, what would she be like?
2491 
2492 The door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped off
2493 their hats.
2494 
2495 She looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had hoped she
2496 would look.
2497 
2498 “Where am I?” she said.
2499 
2500 Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in. “Wendy lady,” he
2501 said rapidly, “for you we built this house.”
2502 
2503 “Oh, say you’re pleased,” cried Nibs.
2504 
2505 “Lovely, darling house,” Wendy said, and they were the very words they
2506 had hoped she would say.
2507 
2508 “And we are your children,” cried the twins.
2509 
2510 Then all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, “O Wendy
2511 lady, be our mother.”
2512 
2513 “Ought I?” Wendy said, all shining. “Of course it’s frightfully
2514 fascinating, but you see I am only a little girl. I have no real
2515 experience.”
2516 
2517 “That doesn’t matter,” said Peter, as if he were the only person present
2518 who knew all about it, though he was really the one who knew least.
2519 “What we need is just a nice motherly person.”
2520 
2521 “Oh dear!” Wendy said, “you see, I feel that is exactly what I am.”
2522 
2523 “It is, it is,” they all cried; “we saw it at once.”
2524 
2525 “Very well,” she said, “I will do my best. Come inside at once, you
2526 naughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put you to
2527 bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.”
2528 
2529 In they went; I don’t know how there was room for them, but you can
2530 squeeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of the many
2531 joyous evenings they had with Wendy. By and by she tucked them up in the
2532 great bed in the home under the trees, but she herself slept that night
2533 in the little house, and Peter kept watch outside with drawn sword, for
2534 the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves were on the
2535 prowl. The little house looked so cosy and safe in the darkness, with
2536 a bright light showing through its blinds, and the chimney smoking
2537 beautifully, and Peter standing on guard. After a time he fell asleep,
2538 and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their way home from
2539 an orgy. Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night they
2540 would have mischiefed, but they just tweaked Peter’s nose and passed on.
2541 
2542 
2543 
2544 
2545 Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND
2546 
2547 One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John
2548 and Michael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at the
2549 boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was ignorance, for
2550 unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down, and no
2551 two of the boys were quite the same size. Once you fitted, you drew in
2552 [let out] your breath at the top, and down you went at exactly the
2553 right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately, and so
2554 wriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered the action you are able
2555 to do these things without thinking of them, and nothing can be more
2556 graceful.
2557 
2558 But you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as
2559 carefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the
2560 clothes are made to fit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree.
2561 Usually it is done quite easily, as by your wearing too many garments
2562 or too few, but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only available
2563 tree is an odd shape, Peter does some things to you, and after that you
2564 fit. Once you fit, great care must be taken to go on fitting, and this,
2565 as Wendy was to discover to her delight, keeps a whole family in perfect
2566 condition.
2567 
2568 Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to
2569 be altered a little.
2570 
2571 After a few days’ practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets
2572 in a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under the
2573 ground; especially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all houses
2574 should do, with a floor in which you could dig [for worms] if you wanted
2575 to go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming
2576 colour, which were used as stools. A Never tree tried hard to grow in
2577 the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through,
2578 level with the floor. By tea-time it was always about two feet high, and
2579 then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table;
2580 as soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus
2581 there was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was
2582 in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across
2583 this Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended
2584 her washing. The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down at
2585 6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all the boys slept in it,
2586 except Michael, lying like sardines in a tin. There was a strict rule
2587 against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned at
2588 once. Michael should have used it also, but Wendy would have [desired]
2589 a baby, and he was the littlest, and you know what women are, and the
2590 short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket.
2591 
2592 It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made
2593 of an underground house in the same circumstances. But there was one
2594 recess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private
2595 apartment of Tinker Bell. It could be shut off from the rest of
2596 the house by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious
2597 [particular], always kept drawn when dressing or undressing. No woman,
2598 however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir [dressing room]
2599 and bed-chamber combined. The couch, as she always called it, was
2600 a genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and she varied the bedspreads
2601 according to what fruit-blossom was in season. Her mirror was a
2602 Puss-in-Boots, of which there are now only three, unchipped, known to
2603 fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust and reversible, the chest
2604 of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth, and the carpet and rugs the
2605 best (the early) period of Margery and Robin. There was a chandelier
2606 from Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course she lit the
2607 residence herself. Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house,
2608 as indeed was perhaps inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful,
2609 looked rather conceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently
2610 turned up.
2611 
2612 I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those
2613 rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there were whole
2614 weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was never
2615 above ground. The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the pot, and
2616 even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she had to
2617 keep watching that it came aboil just the same. You never exactly
2618 knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe, it all
2619 depended upon Peter’s whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was part of
2620 a game, but he could not stodge [cram down the food] just to feel
2621 stodgy [stuffed with food], which is what most children like better than
2622 anything else; the next best thing being to talk about it. Make-believe
2623 was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting
2624 rounder. Of course it was trying, but you simply had to follow his lead,
2625 and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree
2626 he let you stodge.
2627 
2628 Wendy’s favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all
2629 gone to bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for
2630 herself; and she occupied it in making new things for them, and putting
2631 double pieces on the knees, for they were all most frightfully hard on
2632 their knees.
2633 
2634 When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a
2635 hole in it, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, “Oh dear, I am sure
2636 I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!”
2637 
2638 Her face beamed when she exclaimed this.
2639 
2640 You remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered that she
2641 had come to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into each
2642 other’s arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.
2643 
2644 As time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had
2645 left behind her? This is a difficult question, because it is quite
2646 impossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is
2647 calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them
2648 than on the mainland. But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry
2649 about her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they
2650 would always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave
2651 her complete ease of mind. What did disturb her at times was that John
2652 remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while
2653 Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.
2654 These things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she
2655 tried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination
2656 papers on it, as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school.
2657 The other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on
2658 joining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table,
2659 writing and thinking hard about the questions she had written on another
2660 slate and passed round. They were the most ordinary questions--“What
2661 was the colour of Mother’s eyes? Which was taller, Father or Mother? Was
2662 Mother blonde or brunette? Answer all three questions if possible.”
2663  “(A) Write an essay of not less than 40 words on How I spent my last
2664 Holidays, or The Characters of Father and Mother compared. Only one of
2665 these to be attempted.” Or “(1) Describe Mother’s laugh; (2) Describe
2666 Father’s laugh; (3) Describe Mother’s Party Dress; (4) Describe the
2667 Kennel and its Inmate.”
2668 
2669 They were just everyday questions like these, and when you could not
2670 answer them you were told to make a cross; and it was really dreadful
2671 what a number of crosses even John made. Of course the only boy who
2672 replied to every question was Slightly, and no one could have been more
2673 hopeful of coming out first, but his answers were perfectly ridiculous,
2674 and he really came out last: a melancholy thing.
2675 
2676 Peter did not compete. For one thing he despised all mothers except
2677 Wendy, and for another he was the only boy on the island who could
2678 neither write nor spell; not the smallest word. He was above all that
2679 sort of thing.
2680 
2681 By the way, the questions were all written in the past tense. What
2682 was the colour of Mother’s eyes, and so on. Wendy, you see, had been
2683 forgetting, too.
2684 
2685 Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but
2686 about this time Peter invented, with Wendy’s help, a new game that
2687 fascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it,
2688 which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his games.
2689 It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of
2690 thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting on stools
2691 flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for walks and
2692 coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly. To see Peter
2693 doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help looking
2694 solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to
2695 do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health. For
2696 several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him; and
2697 John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also; otherwise he would
2698 have treated them severely.
2699 
2700 He often went out alone, and when he came back you were never absolutely
2701 certain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might have forgotten
2702 it so completely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went
2703 out you found the body; and, on the other hand, he might say a great
2704 deal about it, and yet you could not find the body. Sometimes he came
2705 home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed over him and bathed
2706 it in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling tale. But she was never
2707 quite sure, you know. There were, however, many adventures which she
2708 knew to be true because she was in them herself, and there were still
2709 more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were in them and
2710 said they were wholly true. To describe them all would require a book as
2711 large as an English-Latin, Latin-English Dictionary, and the most we can
2712 do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island. The
2713 difficulty is which one to choose. Should we take the brush with the
2714 redskins at Slightly Gulch? It was a sanguinary affair, and
2715 especially interesting as showing one of Peter’s peculiarities, which
2716 was that in the middle of a fight he would suddenly change sides. At the
2717 Gulch, when victory was still in the balance, sometimes leaning this way
2718 and sometimes that, he called out, “I’m redskin to-day; what are you,
2719 Tootles?” And Tootles answered, “Redskin; what are you, Nibs?” and
2720 Nibs said, “Redskin; what are you Twin?” and so on; and they were all
2721 redskins; and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real
2722 redskins fascinated by Peter’s methods, agreed to be lost boys for that
2723 once, and so at it they all went again, more fiercely than ever.
2724 
2725 The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was--but we have not decided
2726 yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a better one
2727 would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground,
2728 when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out
2729 like corks. Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily’s life in the
2730 Mermaids’ Lagoon, and so made her his ally.
2731 
2732 Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might
2733 eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after
2734 another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so
2735 that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and
2736 was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.
2737 
2738 Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter’s friends, particularly
2739 of the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how
2740 the nest fell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and
2741 Peter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed. That is a pretty
2742 story, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be; but if we tell
2743 it we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would
2744 of course be telling two adventures rather than just one. A shorter
2745 adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell’s attempt, with the
2746 help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a
2747 great floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave way and
2748 Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, we might
2749 choose Peter’s defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round him
2750 on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though he
2751 waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on breathlessly
2752 from trees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge.
2753 
2754 Which of these adventures shall we choose? The best way will be to toss
2755 for it.
2756 
2757 I have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one wish that
2758 the gulch or the cake or Tink’s leaf had won. Of course I could do it
2759 again, and make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick
2760 to the lagoon.
2761 
2762 
2763 
2764 
2765 Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS’ LAGOON
2766 
2767 If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a
2768 shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then
2769 if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the
2770 colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire.
2771 But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon. This is the nearest
2772 you ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment; if there
2773 could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the mermaids
2774 singing.
2775 
2776 The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or
2777 floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water,
2778 and so forth. You must not think from this that the mermaids were on
2779 friendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was among Wendy’s lasting
2780 regrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil
2781 word from one of them. When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon
2782 she might see them by the score, especially on Marooners’ Rock, where
2783 they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite
2784 irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within
2785 a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her
2786 with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.
2787 
2788 They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who
2789 chatted with them on Marooners’ Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails
2790 when they got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their combs.
2791 
2792 The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon,
2793 when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for
2794 mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy
2795 had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course
2796 Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules
2797 about every one being in bed by seven. She was often at the lagoon,
2798 however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in
2799 extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The bubbles of many
2800 colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily
2801 from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the
2802 rainbow till they burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and
2803 the keepers only are allowed to use their hands. Sometimes a dozen of
2804 these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a
2805 pretty sight.
2806 
2807 But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by
2808 themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we
2809 have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not
2810 above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of hitting
2811 the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted
2812 it. This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland.
2813 
2814 It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a
2815 rock for half an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy insisted on
2816 their doing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was
2817 make-believe. So they lay there in the sun, and their bodies glistened
2818 in it, while she sat beside them and looked important.
2819 
2820 It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners’ Rock. The rock was
2821 not much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how
2822 not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with
2823 their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was
2824 not looking. She was very busy, stitching.
2825 
2826 While she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over
2827 it, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning
2828 it cold. Wendy could no longer see to thread her needle, and when she
2829 looked up, the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing
2830 place seemed formidable and unfriendly.
2831 
2832 It was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as
2833 night had come. No, worse than that. It had not come, but it had sent
2834 that shiver through the sea to say that it was coming. What was it?
2835 
2836 There crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of Marooners’
2837 Rock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave
2838 them there to drown. They drown when the tide rises, for then it is
2839 submerged.
2840 
2841 Of course she should have roused the children at once; not merely
2842 because of the unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it was
2843 no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly. But she was
2844 a young mother and she did not know this; she thought you simply must
2845 stick to your rule about half an hour after the mid-day meal. So, though
2846 fear was upon her, and she longed to hear male voices, she would not
2847 waken them. Even when she heard the sound of muffled oars, though her
2848 heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them. She stood over them to
2849 let them have their sleep out. Was it not brave of Wendy?
2850 
2851 It was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could
2852 sniff danger even in his sleep. Peter sprang erect, as wide awake at
2853 once as a dog, and with one warning cry he roused the others.
2854 
2855 He stood motionless, one hand to his ear.
2856 
2857 “Pirates!” he cried. The others came closer to him. A strange smile was
2858 playing about his face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered. While that smile
2859 was on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was to stand
2860 ready to obey. The order came sharp and incisive.
2861 
2862 “Dive!”
2863 
2864 There was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted.
2865 Marooners’ Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were
2866 itself marooned.
2867 
2868 The boat drew nearer. It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in
2869 her, Smee and Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger
2870 Lily. Her hands and ankles were tied, and she knew what was to be her
2871 fate. She was to be left on the rock to perish, an end to one of her
2872 race more terrible than death by fire or torture, for is it not written
2873 in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the
2874 happy hunting-ground? Yet her face was impassive; she was the daughter
2875 of a chief, she must die as a chief’s daughter, it is enough.
2876 
2877 They had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth.
2878 No watch was kept on the ship, it being Hook’s boast that the wind of
2879 his name guarded the ship for a mile around. Now her fate would help to
2880 guard it also. One more wail would go the round in that wind by night.
2881 
2882 In the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see the
2883 rock till they crashed into it.
2884 
2885 “Luff, you lubber,” cried an Irish voice that was Smee’s; “here’s the
2886 rock. Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it and
2887 leave her here to drown.”
2888 
2889 It was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the
2890 rock; she was too proud to offer a vain resistance.
2891 
2892 Quite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and
2893 down, Peter’s and Wendy’s. Wendy was crying, for it was the first
2894 tragedy she had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had
2895 forgotten them all. He was less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily: it was
2896 two against one that angered him, and he meant to save her. An easy way
2897 would have been to wait until the pirates had gone, but he was never one
2898 to choose the easy way.
2899 
2900 There was almost nothing he could not do, and he now imitated the voice
2901 of Hook.
2902 
2903 “Ahoy there, you lubbers!” he called. It was a marvellous imitation.
2904 
2905 “The captain!” said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise.
2906 
2907 “He must be swimming out to us,” Starkey said, when they had looked for
2908 him in vain.
2909 
2910 “We are putting the redskin on the rock,” Smee called out.
2911 
2912 “Set her free,” came the astonishing answer.
2913 
2914 “Free!”
2915 
2916 “Yes, cut her bonds and let her go.”
2917 
2918 “But, captain--”
2919 
2920 “At once, d’ye hear,” cried Peter, “or I’ll plunge my hook in you.”
2921 
2922 “This is queer!” Smee gasped.
2923 
2924 “Better do what the captain orders,” said Starkey nervously.
2925 
2926 “Ay, ay,” Smee said, and he cut Tiger Lily’s cords. At once like an eel
2927 she slid between Starkey’s legs into the water.
2928 
2929 Of course Wendy was very elated over Peter’s cleverness; but she knew
2930 that he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray
2931 himself, so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth. But it was
2932 stayed even in the act, for “Boat ahoy!” rang over the lagoon in Hook’s
2933 voice, and this time it was not Peter who had spoken.
2934 
2935 Peter may have been about to crow, but his face puckered in a whistle of
2936 surprise instead.
2937 
2938 “Boat ahoy!” again came the voice.
2939 
2940 Now Wendy understood. The real Hook was also in the water.
2941 
2942 He was swimming to the boat, and as his men showed a light to guide him
2943 he had soon reached them. In the light of the lantern Wendy saw his hook
2944 grip the boat’s side; she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose dripping
2945 from the water, and, quaking, she would have liked to swim away, but
2946 Peter would not budge. He was tingling with life and also top-heavy with
2947 conceit. “Am I not a wonder, oh, I am a wonder!” he whispered to her,
2948 and though she thought so also, she was really glad for the sake of his
2949 reputation that no one heard him except herself.
2950 
2951 He signed to her to listen.
2952 
2953 The two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their captain
2954 to them, but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of profound
2955 melancholy.
2956 
2957 “Captain, is all well?” they asked timidly, but he answered with a
2958 hollow moan.
2959 
2960 “He sighs,” said Smee.
2961 
2962 “He sighs again,” said Starkey.
2963 
2964 “And yet a third time he sighs,” said Smee.
2965 
2966 Then at last he spoke passionately.
2967 
2968 “The game’s up,” he cried, “those boys have found a mother.”
2969 
2970 Affrighted though she was, Wendy swelled with pride.
2971 
2972 “O evil day!” cried Starkey.
2973 
2974 “What’s a mother?” asked the ignorant Smee.
2975 
2976 Wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed. “He doesn’t know!” and always
2977 after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee would be
2978 her one.
2979 
2980 Peter pulled her beneath the water, for Hook had started up, crying,
2981 “What was that?”
2982 
2983 “I heard nothing,” said Starkey, raising the lantern over the waters,
2984 and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight. It was the nest I
2985 have told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never bird was sitting
2986 on it.
2987 
2988 “See,” said Hook in answer to Smee’s question, “that is a mother. What
2989 a lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but would the mother
2990 desert her eggs? No.”
2991 
2992 There was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he recalled innocent
2993 days when--but he brushed away this weakness with his hook.
2994 
2995 Smee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but
2996 the more suspicious Starkey said, “If she is a mother, perhaps she is
2997 hanging about here to help Peter.”
2998 
2999 Hook winced. “Ay,” he said, “that is the fear that haunts me.”
3000 
3001 He was roused from this dejection by Smee’s eager voice.
3002 
3003 “Captain,” said Smee, “could we not kidnap these boys’ mother and make
3004 her our mother?”
3005 
3006 “It is a princely scheme,” cried Hook, and at once it took practical
3007 shape in his great brain. “We will seize the children and carry them to
3008 the boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and Wendy shall be our
3009 mother.”
3010 
3011 Again Wendy forgot herself.
3012 
3013 “Never!” she cried, and bobbed.
3014 
3015 “What was that?”
3016 
3017 But they could see nothing. They thought it must have been a leaf in the
3018 wind. “Do you agree, my bullies?” asked Hook.
3019 
3020 “There is my hand on it,” they both said.
3021 
3022 “And there is my hook. Swear.”
3023 
3024 They all swore. By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly Hook
3025 remembered Tiger Lily.
3026 
3027 “Where is the redskin?” he demanded abruptly.
3028 
3029 He had a playful humour at moments, and they thought this was one of the
3030 moments.
3031 
3032 “That is all right, captain,” Smee answered complacently; “we let her
3033 go.”
3034 
3035 “Let her go!” cried Hook.
3036 
3037 “‘Twas your own orders,” the bo’sun faltered.
3038 
3039 “You called over the water to us to let her go,” said Starkey.
3040 
3041 “Brimstone and gall,” thundered Hook, “what cozening [cheating] is
3042 going on here!” His face had gone black with rage, but he saw that they
3043 believed their words, and he was startled. “Lads,” he said, shaking a
3044 little, “I gave no such order.”
3045 
3046 “It is passing queer,” Smee said, and they all fidgeted uncomfortably.
3047 Hook raised his voice, but there was a quiver in it.
3048 
3049 “Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night,” he cried, “dost hear
3050 me?”
3051 
3052 Of course Peter should have kept quiet, but of course he did not. He
3053 immediately answered in Hook’s voice:
3054 
3055 “Odds, bobs, hammer and tongs, I hear you.”
3056 
3057 In that supreme moment Hook did not blanch, even at the gills, but Smee
3058 and Starkey clung to each other in terror.
3059 
3060 “Who are you, stranger? Speak!” Hook demanded.
3061 
3062 “I am James Hook,” replied the voice, “captain of the JOLLY ROGER.”
3063 
3064 “You are not; you are not,” Hook cried hoarsely.
3065 
3066 “Brimstone and gall,” the voice retorted, “say that again, and I’ll cast
3067 anchor in you.”
3068 
3069 Hook tried a more ingratiating manner. “If you are Hook,” he said almost
3070 humbly, “come tell me, who am I?”
3071 
3072 “A codfish,” replied the voice, “only a codfish.”
3073 
3074 “A codfish!” Hook echoed blankly, and it was then, but not till then,
3075 that his proud spirit broke. He saw his men draw back from him.
3076 
3077 “Have we been captained all this time by a codfish!” they muttered. “It
3078 is lowering to our pride.”
3079 
3080 They were his dogs snapping at him, but, tragic figure though he had
3081 become, he scarcely heeded them. Against such fearful evidence it was
3082 not their belief in him that he needed, it was his own. He felt his ego
3083 slipping from him. “Don’t desert me, bully,” he whispered hoarsely to
3084 it.
3085 
3086 In his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all the
3087 great pirates, and it sometimes gave him intuitions. Suddenly he tried
3088 the guessing game.
3089 
3090 “Hook,” he called, “have you another voice?”
3091 
3092 Now Peter could never resist a game, and he answered blithely in his own
3093 voice, “I have.”
3094 
3095 “And another name?”
3096 
3097 “Ay, ay.”
3098 
3099 “Vegetable?” asked Hook.
3100 
3101 “No.”
3102 
3103 “Mineral?”
3104 
3105 “No.”
3106 
3107 “Animal?”
3108 
3109 “Yes.”
3110 
3111 “Man?”
3112 
3113 “No!” This answer rang out scornfully.
3114 
3115 “Boy?”
3116 
3117 “Yes.”
3118 
3119 “Ordinary boy?”
3120 
3121 “No!”
3122 
3123 “Wonderful boy?”
3124 
3125 To Wendy’s pain the answer that rang out this time was “Yes.”
3126 
3127 “Are you in England?”
3128 
3129 “No.”
3130 
3131 “Are you here?”
3132 
3133 “Yes.”
3134 
3135 Hook was completely puzzled. “You ask him some questions,” he said to
3136 the others, wiping his damp brow.
3137 
3138 Smee reflected. “I can’t think of a thing,” he said regretfully.
3139 
3140 “Can’t guess, can’t guess!” crowed Peter. “Do you give it up?”
3141 
3142 Of course in his pride he was carrying the game too far, and the
3143 miscreants [villains] saw their chance.
3144 
3145 “Yes, yes,” they answered eagerly.
3146 
3147 “Well, then,” he cried, “I am Peter Pan.”
3148 
3149 Pan!
3150 
3151 In a moment Hook was himself again, and Smee and Starkey were his
3152 faithful henchmen.
3153 
3154 “Now we have him,” Hook shouted. “Into the water, Smee. Starkey, mind
3155 the boat. Take him dead or alive!”
3156 
3157 He leaped as he spoke, and simultaneously came the gay voice of Peter.
3158 
3159 “Are you ready, boys?”
3160 
3161 “Ay, ay,” from various parts of the lagoon.
3162 
3163 “Then lam into the pirates.”
3164 
3165 The fight was short and sharp. First to draw blood was John, who
3166 gallantly climbed into the boat and held Starkey. There was fierce
3167 struggle, in which the cutlass was torn from the pirate’s grasp. He
3168 wriggled overboard and John leapt after him. The dinghy drifted away.
3169 
3170 Here and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash
3171 of steel followed by a cry or a whoop. In the confusion some struck at
3172 their own side. The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the fourth rib, but
3173 he was himself pinked [nicked] in turn by Curly. Farther from the rock
3174 Starkey was pressing Slightly and the twins hard.
3175 
3176 Where all this time was Peter? He was seeking bigger game.
3177 
3178 The others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for backing
3179 from the pirate captain. His iron claw made a circle of dead water round
3180 him, from which they fled like affrighted fishes.
3181 
3182 But there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared to enter
3183 that circle.
3184 
3185 Strangely, it was not in the water that they met. Hook rose to the rock
3186 to breathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the opposite
3187 side. The rock was slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather than
3188 climb. Neither knew that the other was coming. Each feeling for a grip
3189 met the other’s arm: in surprise they raised their heads; their faces
3190 were almost touching; so they met.
3191 
3192 Some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell to
3193 [began combat] they had a sinking [feeling in the stomach]. Had it been
3194 so with Peter at that moment I would admit it. After all, he was the
3195 only man that the Sea-Cook had feared. But Peter had no sinking, he had
3196 one feeling only, gladness; and he gnashed his pretty teeth with joy.
3197 Quick as thought he snatched a knife from Hook’s belt and was about to
3198 drive it home, when he saw that he was higher up the rock than his foe.
3199 It would not have been fighting fair. He gave the pirate a hand to help
3200 him up.
3201 
3202 It was then that Hook bit him.
3203 
3204 Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter. It made
3205 him quite helpless. He could only stare, horrified. Every child is
3206 affected thus the first time he is treated unfairly. All he thinks he
3207 has a right to when he comes to you to be yours is fairness. After
3208 you have been unfair to him he will love you again, but will never
3209 afterwards be quite the same boy. No one ever gets over the first
3210 unfairness; no one except Peter. He often met it, but he always forgot
3211 it. I suppose that was the real difference between him and all the rest.
3212 
3213 So when he met it now it was like the first time; and he could just
3214 stare, helpless. Twice the iron hand clawed him.
3215 
3216 A few moments afterwards the other boys saw Hook in the water striking
3217 wildly for the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now, only white
3218 fear, for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On ordinary
3219 occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering; but now they were
3220 uneasy, for they had lost both Peter and Wendy, and were scouring the
3221 lagoon for them, calling them by name. They found the dinghy and went
3222 home in it, shouting “Peter, Wendy” as they went, but no answer came
3223 save mocking laughter from the mermaids. “They must be swimming back or
3224 flying,” the boys concluded. They were not very anxious, because they
3225 had such faith in Peter. They chuckled, boylike, because they would be
3226 late for bed; and it was all mother Wendy’s fault!
3227 
3228 When their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon, and
3229 then a feeble cry.
3230 
3231 “Help, help!”
3232 
3233 Two small figures were beating against the rock; the girl had fainted
3234 and lay on the boy’s arm. With a last effort Peter pulled her up the
3235 rock and then lay down beside her. Even as he also fainted he saw that
3236 the water was rising. He knew that they would soon be drowned, but he
3237 could do no more.
3238 
3239 As they lay side by side a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and began
3240 pulling her softly into the water. Peter, feeling her slip from him,
3241 woke with a start, and was just in time to draw her back. But he had to
3242 tell her the truth.
3243 
3244 “We are on the rock, Wendy,” he said, “but it is growing smaller. Soon
3245 the water will be over it.”
3246 
3247 She did not understand even now.
3248 
3249 “We must go,” she said, almost brightly.
3250 
3251 “Yes,” he answered faintly.
3252 
3253 “Shall we swim or fly, Peter?”
3254 
3255 He had to tell her.
3256 
3257 “Do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy, without
3258 my help?”
3259 
3260 She had to admit that she was too tired.
3261 
3262 He moaned.
3263 
3264 “What is it?” she asked, anxious about him at once.
3265 
3266 “I can’t help you, Wendy. Hook wounded me. I can neither fly nor swim.”
3267 
3268 “Do you mean we shall both be drowned?”
3269 
3270 “Look how the water is rising.”
3271 
3272 They put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight. They thought
3273 they would soon be no more. As they sat thus something brushed against
3274 Peter as light as a kiss, and stayed there, as if saying timidly, “Can I
3275 be of any use?”
3276 
3277 It was the tail of a kite, which Michael had made some days before. It
3278 had torn itself out of his hand and floated away.
3279 
3280 “Michael’s kite,” Peter said without interest, but next moment he had
3281 seized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him.
3282 
3283 “It lifted Michael off the ground,” he cried; “why should it not carry
3284 you?”
3285 
3286 “Both of us!”
3287 
3288 “It can’t lift two; Michael and Curly tried.”
3289 
3290 “Let us draw lots,” Wendy said bravely.
3291 
3292 “And you a lady; never.” Already he had tied the tail round her. She
3293 clung to him; she refused to go without him; but with a “Good-bye,
3294 Wendy,” he pushed her from the rock; and in a few minutes she was borne
3295 out of his sight. Peter was alone on the lagoon.
3296 
3297 The rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged. Pale rays of
3298 light tiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a
3299 sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world: the
3300 mermaids calling to the moon.
3301 
3302 Peter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A
3303 tremour ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on
3304 the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them, and
3305 Peter felt just the one. Next moment he was standing erect on the rock
3306 again, with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him. It was
3307 saying, “To die will be an awfully big adventure.”
3308 
3309 
3310 
3311 
3312 Chapter 9 THE NEVER BIRD
3313 
3314 The last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids
3315 retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea. He was too far
3316 away to hear their doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where
3317 they live rings a tiny bell when it opens or closes (as in all the
3318 nicest houses on the mainland), and he heard the bells.
3319 
3320 Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to
3321 pass the time until they made their final gulp, he watched the only
3322 thing on the lagoon. He thought it was a piece of floating paper,
3323 perhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long it would take to
3324 drift ashore.
3325 
3326 Presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon
3327 the lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide,
3328 and sometimes winning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to
3329 the weaker side, could not help clapping; it was such a gallant piece of
3330 paper.
3331 
3332 It was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making
3333 desperate efforts to reach Peter on the nest. By working her wings, in a
3334 way she had learned since the nest fell into the water, she was able to
3335 some extent to guide her strange craft, but by the time Peter recognised
3336 her she was very exhausted. She had come to save him, to give him her
3337 nest, though there were eggs in it. I rather wonder at the bird, for
3338 though he had been nice to her, he had also sometimes tormented her. I
3339 can suppose only that, like Mrs. Darling and the rest of them, she was
3340 melted because he had all his first teeth.
3341 
3342 She called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her
3343 what she was doing there; but of course neither of them understood
3344 the other’s language. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds
3345 freely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend that this were such a
3346 story, and say that Peter replied intelligently to the Never bird; but
3347 truth is best, and I want to tell you only what really happened. Well,
3348 not only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their
3349 manners.
3350 
3351 “I--want--you--to--get--into--the--nest,” the bird called, speaking as
3352 slowly and distinctly as possible, “and--then--you--can--drift--ashore,
3353 but--I--am--too--tired--to--bring--it--any--nearer--so--you--must--try
3354 to--swim--to--it.”
3355 
3356 “What are you quacking about?” Peter answered. “Why don’t you let the
3357 nest drift as usual?”
3358 
3359 “I--want--you--” the bird said, and repeated it all over.
3360 
3361 Then Peter tried slow and distinct.
3362 
3363 “What--are--you--quacking--about?” and so on.
3364 
3365 The Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.
3366 
3367 “You dunderheaded little jay!” she screamed, “Why don’t you do as I tell
3368 you?”
3369 
3370 Peter felt that she was calling him names, and at a venture he retorted
3371 hotly:
3372 
3373 “So are you!”
3374 
3375 Then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark:
3376 
3377 “Shut up!”
3378 
3379 “Shut up!”
3380 
3381 Nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could, and by
3382 one last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock. Then up
3383 she flew; deserting her eggs, so as to make her meaning clear.
3384 
3385 Then at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks
3386 to the bird as she fluttered overhead. It was not to receive his thanks,
3387 however, that she hung there in the sky; it was not even to watch him
3388 get into the nest; it was to see what he did with her eggs.
3389 
3390 There were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and reflected.
3391 The bird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see the last of
3392 them; but she could not help peeping between the feathers.
3393 
3394 I forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock,
3395 driven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried
3396 treasure. The children had discovered the glittering hoard, and when in
3397 a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores, diamonds, pearls
3398 and pieces of eight to the gulls, who pounced upon them for food, and
3399 then flew away, raging at the scurvy trick that had been played upon
3400 them. The stave was still there, and on it Starkey had hung his hat, a
3401 deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim. Peter put the eggs into
3402 this hat and set it on the lagoon. It floated beautifully.
3403 
3404 The Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her
3405 admiration of him; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her. Then
3406 he got into the nest, reared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his
3407 shirt for a sail. At the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the
3408 hat and once more sat snugly on her eggs. She drifted in one direction,
3409 and he was borne off in another, both cheering.
3410 
3411 Of course when Peter landed he beached his barque [small ship, actually
3412 the Never Bird’s nest in this particular case in point] in a place where
3413 the bird would easily find it; but the hat was such a great success that
3414 she abandoned the nest. It drifted about till it went to pieces, and
3415 often Starkey came to the shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter
3416 feelings watched the bird sitting on his hat. As we shall not see her
3417 again, it may be worth mentioning here that all Never birds now build
3418 in that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which the youngsters take an
3419 airing.
3420 
3421 Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground
3422 almost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by
3423 the kite. Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest
3424 adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed. This so
3425 inflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up still
3426 longer, such as demanding bandages; but Wendy, though glorying in having
3427 them all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the lateness of
3428 the hour, and cried, “To bed, to bed,” in a voice that had to be obeyed.
3429 Next day, however, she was awfully tender, and gave out bandages to
3430 every one, and they played till bed-time at limping about and carrying
3431 their arms in slings.

3435 
3436 Chapter 10 THE HAPPY HOME
3437 
3438 One important result of the brush [with the pirates] on the lagoon was
3439 that it made the redskins their friends. Peter had saved Tiger Lily from
3440 a dreadful fate, and now there was nothing she and her braves would not
3441 do for him. All night they sat above, keeping watch over the home under
3442 the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously
3443 could not be much longer delayed. Even by day they hung about, smoking
3444 the pipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted tit-bits to eat.
3445 
3446 They called Peter the Great White Father, prostrating themselves [lying
3447 down] before him; and he liked this tremendously, so that it was not
3448 really good for him.
3449 
3450 “The great white father,” he would say to them in a very lordly manner,
3451 as they grovelled at his feet, “is glad to see the Piccaninny warriors
3452 protecting his wigwam from the pirates.”
3453 
3454 “Me Tiger Lily,” that lovely creature would reply. “Peter Pan save me,
3455 me his velly nice friend. Me no let pirates hurt him.”
3456 
3457 She was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought it his
3458 due, and he would answer condescendingly, “It is good. Peter Pan has
3459 spoken.”
3460 
3461 Always when he said, “Peter Pan has spoken,” it meant that they must now
3462 shut up, and they accepted it humbly in that spirit; but they were by
3463 no means so respectful to the other boys, whom they looked upon as just
3464 ordinary braves. They said “How-do?” to them, and things like that; and
3465 what annoyed the boys was that Peter seemed to think this all right.
3466 
3467 Secretly Wendy sympathised with them a little, but she was far too loyal
3468 a housewife to listen to any complaints against father. “Father knows
3469 best,” she always said, whatever her private opinion must be. Her
3470 private opinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw.
3471 
3472 We have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the
3473 Night of Nights, because of its adventures and their upshot. The day, as
3474 if quietly gathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the
3475 redskins in their blankets were at their posts above, while, below, the
3476 children were having their evening meal; all except Peter, who had gone
3477 out to get the time. The way you got the time on the island was to find
3478 the crocodile, and then stay near him till the clock struck.
3479 
3480 The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the
3481 board, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and
3482 recriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening.
3483 To be sure, she did not mind noise, but she simply would not have them
3484 grabbing things, and then excusing themselves by saying that Tootles had
3485 pushed their elbow. There was a fixed rule that they must never hit back
3486 at meals, but should refer the matter of dispute to Wendy by raising
3487 the right arm politely and saying, “I complain of so-and-so;” but what
3488 usually happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too much.
3489 
3490 “Silence,” cried Wendy when for the twentieth time she had told them
3491 that they were not all to speak at once. “Is your mug empty, Slightly
3492 darling?”
3493 
3494 “Not quite empty, mummy,” Slightly said, after looking into an imaginary
3495 mug.
3496 
3497 “He hasn’t even begun to drink his milk,” Nibs interposed.
3498 
3499 This was telling, and Slightly seized his chance.
3500 
3501 “I complain of Nibs,” he cried promptly.
3502 
3503 John, however, had held up his hand first.
3504 
3505 “Well, John?”
3506 
3507 “May I sit in Peter’s chair, as he is not here?”
3508 
3509 “Sit in father’s chair, John!” Wendy was scandalised. “Certainly not.”
3510 
3511 “He is not really our father,” John answered. “He didn’t even know how a
3512 father does till I showed him.”
3513 
3514 This was grumbling. “We complain of John,” cried the twins.
3515 
3516 Tootles held up his hand. He was so much the humblest of them, indeed he
3517 was the only humble one, that Wendy was specially gentle with him.
3518 
3519 “I don’t suppose,” Tootles said diffidently [bashfully or timidly],
3520 “that I could be father.”
3521 
3522 “No, Tootles.”
3523 
3524 Once Tootles began, which was not very often, he had a silly way of
3525 going on.
3526 
3527 “As I can’t be father,” he said heavily, “I don’t suppose, Michael, you
3528 would let me be baby?”
3529 
3530 “No, I won’t,” Michael rapped out. He was already in his basket.
3531 
3532 “As I can’t be baby,” Tootles said, getting heavier and heavier and
3533 heavier, “do you think I could be a twin?”
3534 
3535 “No, indeed,” replied the twins; “it’s awfully difficult to be a twin.”
3536 
3537 “As I can’t be anything important,” said Tootles, “would any of you like
3538 to see me do a trick?”
3539 
3540 “No,” they all replied.
3541 
3542 Then at last he stopped. “I hadn’t really any hope,” he said.
3543 
3544 The hateful telling broke out again.
3545 
3546 “Slightly is coughing on the table.”
3547 
3548 “The twins began with cheese-cakes.”
3549 
3550 “Curly is taking both butter and honey.”
3551 
3552 “Nibs is speaking with his mouth full.”
3553 
3554 “I complain of the twins.”
3555 
3556 “I complain of Curly.”
3557 
3558 “I complain of Nibs.”
3559 
3560 “Oh dear, oh dear,” cried Wendy, “I’m sure I sometimes think that
3561 spinsters are to be envied.”
3562 
3563 She told them to clear away, and sat down to her work-basket, a heavy
3564 load of stockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual.
3565 
3566 “Wendy,” remonstrated [scolded] Michael, “I’m too big for a cradle.”
3567 
3568 “I must have somebody in a cradle,” she said almost tartly, “and you
3569 are the littlest. A cradle is such a nice homely thing to have about a
3570 house.”
3571 
3572 While she sewed they played around her; such a group of happy faces
3573 and dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire. It had become a very
3574 familiar scene, this, in the home under the ground, but we are looking
3575 on it for the last time.
3576 
3577 There was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the first to
3578 recognize it.
3579 
3580 “Children, I hear your father’s step. He likes you to meet him at the
3581 door.”
3582 
3583 Above, the redskins crouched before Peter.
3584 
3585 “Watch well, braves. I have spoken.”
3586 
3587 And then, as so often before, the gay children dragged him from his
3588 tree. As so often before, but never again.
3589 
3590 He had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for Wendy.
3591 
3592 “Peter, you just spoil them, you know,” Wendy simpered [exaggerated a
3593 smile].
3594 
3595 “Ah, old lady,” said Peter, hanging up his gun.
3596 
3597 “It was me told him mothers are called old lady,” Michael whispered to
3598 Curly.
3599 
3600 “I complain of Michael,” said Curly instantly.
3601 
3602 The first twin came to Peter. “Father, we want to dance.”
3603 
3604 “Dance away, my little man,” said Peter, who was in high good humour.
3605 
3606 “But we want you to dance.”
3607 
3608 Peter was really the best dancer among them, but he pretended to be
3609 scandalised.
3610 
3611 “Me! My old bones would rattle!”
3612 
3613 “And mummy too.”
3614 
3615 “What,” cried Wendy, “the mother of such an armful, dance!”
3616 
3617 “But on a Saturday night,” Slightly insinuated.
3618 
3619 It was not really Saturday night, at least it may have been, for
3620 they had long lost count of the days; but always if they wanted to do
3621 anything special they said this was Saturday night, and then they did
3622 it.
3623 
3624 “Of course it is Saturday night, Peter,” Wendy said, relenting.
3625 
3626 “People of our figure, Wendy!”
3627 
3628 “But it is only among our own progeny [children].”
3629 
3630 “True, true.”
3631 
3632 So they were told they could dance, but they must put on their nighties
3633 first.
3634 
3635 “Ah, old lady,” Peter said aside to Wendy, warming himself by the fire
3636 and looking down at her as she sat turning a heel, “there is nothing
3637 more pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day’s toil is over
3638 than to rest by the fire with the little ones near by.”
3639 
3640 “It is sweet, Peter, isn’t it?” Wendy said, frightfully gratified.
3641 “Peter, I think Curly has your nose.”
3642 
3643 “Michael takes after you.”
3644 
3645 She went to him and put her hand on his shoulder.
3646 
3647 “Dear Peter,” she said, “with such a large family, of course, I have now
3648 passed my best, but you don’t want to [ex]change me, do you?”
3649 
3650 “No, Wendy.”
3651 
3652 Certainly he did not want a change, but he looked at her uncomfortably,
3653 blinking, you know, like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep.
3654 
3655 “Peter, what is it?”
3656 
3657 “I was just thinking,” he said, a little scared. “It is only
3658 make-believe, isn’t it, that I am their father?”
3659 
3660 “Oh yes,” Wendy said primly [formally and properly].
3661 
3662 “You see,” he continued apologetically, “it would make me seem so old to
3663 be their real father.”
3664 
3665 “But they are ours, Peter, yours and mine.”
3666 
3667 “But not really, Wendy?” he asked anxiously.
3668 
3669 “Not if you don’t wish it,” she replied; and she distinctly heard his
3670 sigh of relief. “Peter,” she asked, trying to speak firmly, “what are
3671 your exact feelings to [about] me?”
3672 
3673 “Those of a devoted son, Wendy.”
3674 
3675 “I thought so,” she said, and went and sat by herself at the extreme end
3676 of the room.
3677 
3678 “You are so queer,” he said, frankly puzzled, “and Tiger Lily is just
3679 the same. There is something she wants to be to me, but she says it is
3680 not my mother.”
3681 
3682 “No, indeed, it is not,” Wendy replied with frightful emphasis. Now we
3683 know why she was prejudiced against the redskins.
3684 
3685 “Then what is it?”
3686 
3687 “It isn’t for a lady to tell.”
3688 
3689 “Oh, very well,” Peter said, a little nettled. “Perhaps Tinker Bell will
3690 tell me.”
3691 
3692 “Oh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you,” Wendy retorted scornfully. “She is
3693 an abandoned little creature.”
3694 
3695 Here Tink, who was in her bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out something
3696 impudent.
3697 
3698 “She says she glories in being abandoned,” Peter interpreted.
3699 
3700 He had a sudden idea. “Perhaps Tink wants to be my mother?”
3701 
3702 “You silly ass!” cried Tinker Bell in a passion.
3703 
3704 She had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation.
3705 
3706 “I almost agree with her,” Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping! But she
3707 had been much tried, and she little knew what was to happen before the
3708 night was out. If she had known she would not have snapped.
3709 
3710 None of them knew. Perhaps it was best not to know. Their ignorance
3711 gave them one more glad hour; and as it was to be their last hour on the
3712 island, let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it. They
3713 sang and danced in their night-gowns. Such a deliciously creepy song
3714 it was, in which they pretended to be frightened at their own shadows,
3715 little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them, from whom
3716 they would shrink in real fear. So uproariously gay was the dance, and
3717 how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it! It was a pillow
3718 fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, the pillows
3719 insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may never
3720 meet again. The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy’s
3721 good-night story! Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but
3722 the beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the others
3723 but himself, and he said gloomily:
3724 
3725 “Yes, it is a dull beginning. I say, let us pretend that it is the end.”
3726 
3727 And then at last they all got into bed for Wendy’s story, the story they
3728 loved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to tell this
3729 story he left the room or put his hands over his ears; and possibly if
3730 he had done either of those things this time they might all still be on
3731 the island. But to-night he remained on his stool; and we shall see what
3732 happened.
3733 
3734 
3735 
3736 
3737 Chapter 11 WENDY’S STORY
3738 
3739 “Listen, then,” said Wendy, settling down to her story, with Michael at
3740 her feet and seven boys in the bed. “There was once a gentleman--”
3741 
3742 “I had rather he had been a lady,” Curly said.
3743 
3744 “I wish he had been a white rat,” said Nibs.
3745 
3746 “Quiet,” their mother admonished [cautioned] them. “There was a lady
3747 also, and--”
3748 
3749 “Oh, mummy,” cried the first twin, “you mean that there is a lady also,
3750 don’t you? She is not dead, is she?”
3751 
3752 “Oh, no.”
3753 
3754 “I am awfully glad she isn’t dead,” said Tootles. “Are you glad, John?”
3755 
3756 “Of course I am.”
3757 
3758 “Are you glad, Nibs?”
3759 
3760 “Rather.”
3761 
3762 “Are you glad, Twins?”
3763 
3764 “We are glad.”
3765 
3766 “Oh dear,” sighed Wendy.
3767 
3768 “Little less noise there,” Peter called out, determined that she should
3769 have fair play, however beastly a story it might be in his opinion.
3770 
3771 “The gentleman’s name,” Wendy continued, “was Mr. Darling, and her name
3772 was Mrs. Darling.”
3773 
3774 “I knew them,” John said, to annoy the others.
3775 
3776 “I think I knew them,” said Michael rather doubtfully.
3777 
3778 “They were married, you know,” explained Wendy, “and what do you think
3779 they had?”
3780 
3781 “White rats,” cried Nibs, inspired.
3782 
3783 “No.”
3784 
3785 “It’s awfully puzzling,” said Tootles, who knew the story by heart.
3786 
3787 “Quiet, Tootles. They had three descendants.”
3788 
3789 “What is descendants?”
3790 
3791 “Well, you are one, Twin.”
3792 
3793 “Did you hear that, John? I am a descendant.”
3794 
3795 “Descendants are only children,” said John.
3796 
3797 “Oh dear, oh dear,” sighed Wendy. “Now these three children had a
3798 faithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her and
3799 chained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew away.”
3800 
3801 “It’s an awfully good story,” said Nibs.
3802 
3803 “They flew away,” Wendy continued, “to the Neverland, where the lost
3804 children are.”
3805 
3806 “I just thought they did,” Curly broke in excitedly. “I don’t know how
3807 it is, but I just thought they did!”
3808 
3809 “O Wendy,” cried Tootles, “was one of the lost children called Tootles?”
3810 
3811 “Yes, he was.”
3812 
3813 “I am in a story. Hurrah, I am in a story, Nibs.”
3814 
3815 “Hush. Now I want you to consider the feelings of the unhappy parents
3816 with all their children flown away.”
3817 
3818 “Oo!” they all moaned, though they were not really considering the
3819 feelings of the unhappy parents one jot.
3820 
3821 “Think of the empty beds!”
3822 
3823 “Oo!”
3824 
3825 “It’s awfully sad,” the first twin said cheerfully.
3826 
3827 “I don’t see how it can have a happy ending,” said the second twin. “Do
3828 you, Nibs?”
3829 
3830 “I’m frightfully anxious.”
3831 
3832 “If you knew how great is a mother’s love,” Wendy told them
3833 triumphantly, “you would have no fear.” She had now come to the part
3834 that Peter hated.
3835 
3836 “I do like a mother’s love,” said Tootles, hitting Nibs with a pillow.
3837 “Do you like a mother’s love, Nibs?”
3838 
3839 “I do just,” said Nibs, hitting back.
3840 
3841 “You see,” Wendy said complacently, “our heroine knew that the mother
3842 would always leave the window open for her children to fly back by; so
3843 they stayed away for years and had a lovely time.”
3844 
3845 “Did they ever go back?”
3846 
3847 “Let us now,” said Wendy, bracing herself up for her finest effort,
3848 “take a peep into the future;” and they all gave themselves the twist
3849 that makes peeps into the future easier. “Years have rolled by, and who
3850 is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at London Station?”
3851 
3852 “O Wendy, who is she?” cried Nibs, every bit as excited as if he didn’t
3853 know.
3854 
3855 “Can it be--yes--no--it is--the fair Wendy!”
3856 
3857 “Oh!”
3858 
3859 “And who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her, now grown to
3860 man’s estate? Can they be John and Michael? They are!”
3861 
3862 “Oh!”
3863 
3864 “‘See, dear brothers,’ says Wendy pointing upwards, ‘there is the window
3865 still standing open. Ah, now we are rewarded for our sublime faith in a
3866 mother’s love.’ So up they flew to their mummy and daddy, and pen cannot
3867 describe the happy scene, over which we draw a veil.”
3868 
3869 That was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair
3870 narrator herself. Everything just as it should be, you see. Off we skip
3871 like the most heartless things in the world, which is what children are,
3872 but so attractive; and we have an entirely selfish time, and then when
3873 we have need of special attention we nobly return for it, confident that
3874 we shall be rewarded instead of smacked.
3875 
3876 So great indeed was their faith in a mother’s love that they felt they
3877 could afford to be callous for a bit longer.
3878 
3879 But there was one there who knew better, and when Wendy finished he
3880 uttered a hollow groan.
3881 
3882 “What is it, Peter?” she cried, running to him, thinking he was ill. She
3883 felt him solicitously, lower down than his chest. “Where is it, Peter?”
3884 
3885 “It isn’t that kind of pain,” Peter replied darkly.
3886 
3887 “Then what kind is it?”
3888 
3889 “Wendy, you are wrong about mothers.”
3890 
3891 They all gathered round him in affright, so alarming was his agitation;
3892 and with a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed.
3893 
3894 “Long ago,” he said, “I thought like you that my mother would always
3895 keep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and moons and
3896 moons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had
3897 forgotten all about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my
3898 bed.”
3899 
3900 I am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was true; and it
3901 scared them.
3902 
3903 “Are you sure mothers are like that?”
3904 
3905 “Yes.”
3906 
3907 So this was the truth about mothers. The toads!
3908 
3909 Still it is best to be careful; and no one knows so quickly as a child
3910 when he should give in. “Wendy, let us [let’s] go home,” cried John and
3911 Michael together.
3912 
3913 “Yes,” she said, clutching them.
3914 
3915 “Not to-night?” asked the lost boys bewildered. They knew in what they
3916 called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother, and
3917 that it is only the mothers who think you can’t.
3918 
3919 “At once,” Wendy replied resolutely, for the horrible thought had come
3920 to her: “Perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time.”
3921 
3922 This dread made her forgetful of what must be Peter’s feelings, and
3923 she said to him rather sharply, “Peter, will you make the necessary
3924 arrangements?”
3925 
3926 “If you wish it,” he replied, as coolly as if she had asked him to pass
3927 the nuts.
3928 
3929 Not so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them! If she did not mind the
3930 parting, he was going to show her, was Peter, that neither did he.
3931 
3932 But of course he cared very much; and he was so full of wrath against
3933 grown-ups, who, as usual, were spoiling everything, that as soon as he
3934 got inside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short breaths at the
3935 rate of about five to a second. He did this because there is a saying in
3936 the Neverland that, every time you breathe, a grown-up dies; and Peter
3937 was killing them off vindictively as fast as possible.
3938 
3939 Then having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he returned
3940 to the home, where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his absence.
3941 Panic-stricken at the thought of losing Wendy the lost boys had advanced
3942 upon her threateningly.
3943 
3944 “It will be worse than before she came,” they cried.
3945 
3946 “We shan’t let her go.”
3947 
3948 “Let’s keep her prisoner.”
3949 
3950 “Ay, chain her up.”
3951 
3952 In her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn.
3953 
3954 “Tootles,” she cried, “I appeal to you.”
3955 
3956 Was it not strange? She appealed to Tootles, quite the silliest one.
3957 
3958 Grandly, however, did Tootles respond. For that one moment he dropped
3959 his silliness and spoke with dignity.
3960 
3961 “I am just Tootles,” he said, “and nobody minds me. But the first who
3962 does not behave to Wendy like an English gentleman I will blood him
3963 severely.”
3964 
3965 He drew back his hanger; and for that instant his sun was at noon. The
3966 others held back uneasily. Then Peter returned, and they saw at once
3967 that they would get no support from him. He would keep no girl in the
3968 Neverland against her will.
3969 
3970 “Wendy,” he said, striding up and down, “I have asked the redskins to
3971 guide you through the wood, as flying tires you so.”
3972 
3973 “Thank you, Peter.”
3974 
3975 “Then,” he continued, in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to be
3976 obeyed, “Tinker Bell will take you across the sea. Wake her, Nibs.”
3977 
3978 Nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had really
3979 been sitting up in bed listening for some time.
3980 
3981 “Who are you? How dare you? Go away,” she cried.
3982 
3983 “You are to get up, Tink,” Nibs called, “and take Wendy on a journey.”
3984 
3985 Of course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but
3986 she was jolly well determined not to be her courier, and she said so in
3987 still more offensive language. Then she pretended to be asleep again.
3988 
3989 “She says she won’t!” Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such insubordination,
3990 whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady’s chamber.
3991 
3992 “Tink,” he rapped out, “if you don’t get up and dress at once I will
3993 open the curtains, and then we shall all see you in your negligee
3994 [nightgown].”
3995 
3996 This made her leap to the floor. “Who said I wasn’t getting up?” she
3997 cried.
3998 
3999 In the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy, now
4000 equipped with John and Michael for the journey. By this time they were
4001 dejected, not merely because they were about to lose her, but also
4002 because they felt that she was going off to something nice to which they
4003 had not been invited. Novelty was beckoning to them as usual.
4004 
4005 Crediting them with a nobler feeling Wendy melted.
4006 
4007 “Dear ones,” she said, “if you will all come with me I feel almost sure
4008 I can get my father and mother to adopt you.”
4009 
4010 The invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the boys was
4011 thinking exclusively of himself, and at once they jumped with joy.
4012 
4013 “But won’t they think us rather a handful?” Nibs asked in the middle of
4014 his jump.
4015 
4016 “Oh no,” said Wendy, rapidly thinking it out, “it will only mean having
4017 a few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind the screens on
4018 first Thursdays.”
4019 
4020 “Peter, can we go?” they all cried imploringly. They took it for granted
4021 that if they went he would go also, but really they scarcely cared. Thus
4022 children are ever ready, when novelty knocks, to desert their dearest
4023 ones.
4024 
4025 “All right,” Peter replied with a bitter smile, and immediately they
4026 rushed to get their things.
4027 
4028 “And now, Peter,” Wendy said, thinking she had put everything right,
4029 “I am going to give you your medicine before you go.” She loved to give
4030 them medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course it was only
4031 water, but it was out of a bottle, and she always shook the bottle and
4032 counted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On this
4033 occasion, however, she did not give Peter his draught [portion], for
4034 just as she had prepared it, she saw a look on his face that made her
4035 heart sink.
4036 
4037 “Get your things, Peter,” she cried, shaking.
4038 
4039 “No,” he answered, pretending indifference, “I am not going with you,
4040 Wendy.”
4041 
4042 “Yes, Peter.”
4043 
4044 “No.”
4045 
4046 To show that her departure would leave him unmoved, he skipped up and
4047 down the room, playing gaily on his heartless pipes. She had to run
4048 about after him, though it was rather undignified.
4049 
4050 “To find your mother,” she coaxed.
4051 
4052 Now, if Peter had ever quite had a mother, he no longer missed her. He
4053 could do very well without one. He had thought them out, and remembered
4054 only their bad points.
4055 
4056 “No, no,” he told Wendy decisively; “perhaps she would say I was old,
4057 and I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun.”
4058 
4059 “But, Peter--”
4060 
4061 “No.”
4062 
4063 And so the others had to be told.
4064 
4065 “Peter isn’t coming.”
4066 
4067 Peter not coming! They gazed blankly at him, their sticks over their
4068 backs, and on each stick a bundle. Their first thought was that if Peter
4069 was not going he had probably changed his mind about letting them go.
4070 
4071 But he was far too proud for that. “If you find your mothers,” he said
4072 darkly, “I hope you will like them.”
4073 
4074 The awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most
4075 of them began to look rather doubtful. After all, their faces said, were
4076 they not noodles to want to go?
4077 
4078 “Now then,” cried Peter, “no fuss, no blubbering; good-bye, Wendy;” and
4079 he held out his hand cheerily, quite as if they must really go now, for
4080 he had something important to do.
4081 
4082 She had to take his hand, and there was no indication that he would
4083 prefer a thimble.
4084 
4085 “You will remember about changing your flannels, Peter?” she said,
4086 lingering over him. She was always so particular about their flannels.
4087 
4088 “Yes.”
4089 
4090 “And you will take your medicine?”
4091 
4092 “Yes.”
4093 
4094 That seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed. Peter,
4095 however, was not the kind that breaks down before other people. “Are you
4096 ready, Tinker Bell?” he called out.
4097 
4098 “Ay, ay.”
4099 
4100 “Then lead the way.”
4101 
4102 Tink darted up the nearest tree; but no one followed her, for it was
4103 at this moment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the
4104 redskins. Above, where all had been so still, the air was rent with
4105 shrieks and the clash of steel. Below, there was dead silence. Mouths
4106 opened and remained open. Wendy fell on her knees, but her arms were
4107 extended toward Peter. All arms were extended to him, as if suddenly
4108 blown in his direction; they were beseeching him mutely not to desert
4109 them. As for Peter, he seized his sword, the same he thought he had
4110 slain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in his eye.
4111 
4112 
4113 
4114 
4115 Chapter 12 THE CHILDREN ARE CARRIED OFF
4116 
4117 The pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof that the
4118 unscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly, for to surprise redskins
4119 fairly is beyond the wit of the white man.
4120 
4121 By all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the redskin who
4122 attacks, and with the wiliness of his race he does it just before the
4123 dawn, at which time he knows the courage of the whites to be at its
4124 lowest ebb. The white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on
4125 the summit of yonder undulating ground, at the foot of which a stream
4126 runs, for it is destruction to be too far from water. There they await
4127 the onslaught, the inexperienced ones clutching their revolvers and
4128 treading on twigs, but the old hands sleeping tranquilly until just
4129 before the dawn. Through the long black night the savage scouts wriggle,
4130 snake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade. The brushwood
4131 closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has dived.
4132 Not a sound is to be heard, save when they give vent to a wonderful
4133 imitation of the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is answered by other
4134 braves; and some of them do it even better than the coyotes, who are not
4135 very good at it. So the chill hours wear on, and the long suspense is
4136 horribly trying to the paleface who has to live through it for the first
4137 time; but to the trained hand those ghastly calls and still ghastlier
4138 silences are but an intimation of how the night is marching.
4139 
4140 That this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that in
4141 disregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance.
4142 
4143 The Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his honour, and
4144 their whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his.
4145 They left nothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of
4146 their tribe. With that alertness of the senses which is at once the
4147 marvel and despair of civilised peoples, they knew that the pirates were
4148 on the island from the moment one of them trod on a dry stick; and in
4149 an incredibly short space of time the coyote cries began. Every foot of
4150 ground between the spot where Hook had landed his forces and the
4151 home under the trees was stealthily examined by braves wearing their
4152 mocassins with the heels in front. They found only one hillock with a
4153 stream at its base, so that Hook had no choice; here he must establish
4154 himself and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thus mapped
4155 out with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins folded
4156 their blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is to
4157 them, the pearl of manhood squatted above the children’s home, awaiting
4158 the cold moment when they should deal pale death.
4159 
4160 Here dreaming, though wide-awake, of the exquisite tortures to which
4161 they were to put him at break of day, those confiding savages were found
4162 by the treacherous Hook. From the accounts afterwards supplied by such
4163 of the scouts as escaped the carnage, he does not seem even to have
4164 paused at the rising ground, though it is certain that in that grey
4165 light he must have seen it: no thought of waiting to be attacked appears
4166 from first to last to have visited his subtle mind; he would not even
4167 hold off till the night was nearly spent; on he pounded with no policy
4168 but to fall to [get into combat]. What could the bewildered scouts do,
4169 masters as they were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trot
4170 helplessly after him, exposing themselves fatally to view, while they
4171 gave pathetic utterance to the coyote cry.
4172 
4173 Around the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors, and
4174 they suddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them. Fell
4175 from their eyes then the film through which they had looked at
4176 victory. No more would they torture at the stake. For them the happy
4177 hunting-grounds was now. They knew it; but as their father’s sons they
4178 acquitted themselves. Even then they had time to gather in a phalanx
4179 [dense formation] that would have been hard to break had they risen
4180 quickly, but this they were forbidden to do by the traditions of their
4181 race. It is written that the noble savage must never express surprise in
4182 the presence of the white. Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the
4183 pirates must have been to them, they remained stationary for a moment,
4184 not a muscle moving; as if the foe had come by invitation. Then, indeed,
4185 the tradition gallantly upheld, they seized their weapons, and the air
4186 was torn with the war-cry; but it was now too late.
4187 
4188 It is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a
4189 fight. Thus perished many of the flower of the Piccaninny tribe. Not all
4190 unavenged did they die, for with Lean Wolf fell Alf Mason, to disturb
4191 the Spanish Main no more, and among others who bit the dust were Geo.
4192 Scourie, Chas. Turley, and the Alsatian Foggerty. Turley fell to the
4193 tomahawk of the terrible Panther, who ultimately cut a way through the
4194 pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of the tribe.
4195 
4196 To what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for
4197 the historian to decide. Had he waited on the rising ground till the
4198 proper hour he and his men would probably have been butchered; and in
4199 judging him it is only fair to take this into account. What he should
4200 perhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he proposed to
4201 follow a new method. On the other hand, this, as destroying the element
4202 of surprise, would have made his strategy of no avail, so that the whole
4203 question is beset with difficulties. One cannot at least withhold a
4204 reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme,
4205 and the fell [deadly] genius with which it was carried out.
4206 
4207 What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment?
4208 Fain [gladly] would his dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping
4209 their cutlasses, they gathered at a discreet distance from his hook, and
4210 squinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation
4211 must have been in his heart, but his face did not reflect it: ever a
4212 dark and solitary enigma, he stood aloof from his followers in spirit as
4213 in substance.
4214 
4215 The night’s work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins he had
4216 come out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so that he
4217 should get at the honey. It was Pan he wanted, Pan and Wendy and their
4218 band, but chiefly Pan.
4219 
4220 Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man’s hatred
4221 of him. True he had flung Hook’s arm to the crocodile, but even this
4222 and the increased insecurity of life to which it led, owing to
4223 the crocodile’s pertinacity [persistance], hardly account for a
4224 vindictiveness so relentless and malignant. The truth is that there was
4225 a something about Peter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. It
4226 was not his courage, it was not his engaging appearance, it was not--.
4227 There is no beating about the bush, for we know quite well what it was,
4228 and have got to tell. It was Peter’s cockiness.
4229 
4230 This had got on Hook’s nerves; it made his iron claw twitch, and at
4231 night it disturbed him like an insect. While Peter lived, the tortured
4232 man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come.
4233 
4234 The question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get his dogs
4235 down? He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest
4236 ones. They wriggled uncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple
4237 [hesitate] to ram them down with poles.
4238 
4239 In the meantime, what of the boys? We have seen them at the first clang
4240 of the weapons, turned as it were into stone figures, open-mouthed,
4241 all appealing with outstretched arms to Peter; and we return to them as
4242 their mouths close, and their arms fall to their sides. The pandemonium
4243 above has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose, passed like a fierce
4244 gust of wind; but they know that in the passing it has determined their
4245 fate.
4246 
4247 Which side had won?
4248 
4249 The pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the
4250 question put by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter’s answer.
4251 
4252 “If the redskins have won,” he said, “they will beat the tom-tom; it is
4253 always their sign of victory.”
4254 
4255 Now Smee had found the tom-tom, and was at that moment sitting on it.
4256 “You will never hear the tom-tom again,” he muttered, but inaudibly of
4257 course, for strict silence had been enjoined [urged]. To his amazement
4258 Hook signed him to beat the tom-tom, and slowly there came to Smee an
4259 understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order. Never, probably,
4260 had this simple man admired Hook so much.
4261 
4262 Twice Smee beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen
4263 gleefully.
4264 
4265 “The tom-tom,” the miscreants heard Peter cry; “an Indian victory!”
4266 
4267 The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black
4268 hearts above, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes
4269 to Peter. This puzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were
4270 swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the
4271 trees. They smirked at each other and rubbed their hands. Rapidly and
4272 silently Hook gave his orders: one man to each tree, and the others to
4273 arrange themselves in a line two yards apart.
4274 
4275 
4276 
4277 
4278 Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?
4279 
4280 The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better. The first to
4281 emerge from his tree was Curly. He rose out of it into the arms of
4282 Cecco, who flung him to Smee, who flung him to Starkey, who flung him to
4283 Bill Jukes, who flung him to Noodler, and so he was tossed from one to
4284 another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate. All the boys were
4285 plucked from their trees in this ruthless manner; and several of them
4286 were in the air at a time, like bales of goods flung from hand to hand.
4287 
4288 A different treatment was accorded to Wendy, who came last. With
4289 ironical politeness Hook raised his hat to her, and, offering her his
4290 arm, escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged. He
4291 did it with such an air, he was so frightfully DISTINGUE [imposingly
4292 distinguished], that she was too fascinated to cry out. She was only a
4293 little girl.
4294 
4295 Perhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced her,
4296 and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results. Had she
4297 haughtily unhanded him (and we should have loved to write it of her),
4298 she would have been hurled through the air like the others, and then
4299 Hook would probably not have been present at the tying of the children;
4300 and had he not been at the tying he would not have discovered Slightly’s
4301 secret, and without the secret he could not presently have made his foul
4302 attempt on Peter’s life.
4303 
4304 They were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with their knees
4305 close to their ears; and for the trussing of them the black pirate had
4306 cut a rope into nine equal pieces. All went well until Slightly’s turn
4307 came, when he was found to be like those irritating parcels that use up
4308 all the string in going round and leave no tags [ends] with which to
4309 tie a knot. The pirates kicked him in their rage, just as you kick the
4310 parcel (though in fairness you should kick the string); and strange
4311 to say it was Hook who told them to belay their violence. His lip was
4312 curled with malicious triumph. While his dogs were merely sweating
4313 because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one
4314 part he bulged out in another, Hook’s master mind had gone far beneath
4315 Slightly’s surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and his
4316 exultation showed that he had found them. Slightly, white to the gills,
4317 knew that Hook had surprised [discovered] his secret, which was this,
4318 that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need
4319 stick. Poor Slightly, most wretched of all the children now, for he
4320 was in a panic about Peter, bitterly regretted what he had done. Madly
4321 addicted to the drinking of water when he was hot, he had swelled in
4322 consequence to his present girth, and instead of reducing himself to fit
4323 his tree he had, unknown to the others, whittled his tree to make it fit
4324 him.
4325 
4326 Sufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at last lay
4327 at his mercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the
4328 subterranean caverns of his mind crossed his lips; he merely signed
4329 that the captives were to be conveyed to the ship, and that he would be
4330 alone.
4331 
4332 How to convey them? Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be
4333 rolled down hill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a morass.
4334 Again Hook’s genius surmounted difficulties. He indicated that the
4335 little house must be used as a conveyance. The children were flung into
4336 it, four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders, the others fell in
4337 behind, and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange procession
4338 set off through the wood. I don’t know whether any of the children were
4339 crying; if so, the singing drowned the sound; but as the little house
4340 disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet of smoke issued from
4341 its chimney as if defying Hook.
4342 
4343 Hook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service. It dried up any trickle of
4344 pity for him that may have remained in the pirate’s infuriated breast.
4345 
4346 The first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling
4347 night was to tiptoe to Slightly’s tree, and make sure that it provided
4348 him with a passage. Then for long he remained brooding; his hat of ill
4349 omen on the sward, so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play
4350 refreshingly through his hair. Dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes
4351 were as soft as the periwinkle. Intently he listened for any sound from
4352 the nether world, but all was as silent below as above; the house under
4353 the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void. Was
4354 that boy asleep, or did he stand waiting at the foot of Slightly’s tree,
4355 with his dagger in his hand?
4356 
4357 There was no way of knowing, save by going down. Hook let his cloak slip
4358 softly to the ground, and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood
4359 on them, he stepped into the tree. He was a brave man, but for a moment
4360 he had to stop there and wipe his brow, which was dripping like a
4361 candle. Then, silently, he let himself go into the unknown.
4362 
4363 He arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again,
4364 biting at his breath, which had almost left him. As his eyes became
4365 accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees
4366 took shape; but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested, long
4367 sought for and found at last, was the great bed. On the bed lay Peter
4368 fast asleep.
4369 
4370 Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for
4371 a little time after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no
4372 doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care.
4373 Then he decided not to take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy. Then he
4374 lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex her still more; for she
4375 had always tucked them inside it, because you never know that you may
4376 not grow chilly at the turn of the night. Then he nearly cried; but
4377 it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead; so he
4378 laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it.
4379 
4380 Sometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful
4381 than the dreams of other boys. For hours he could not be separated from
4382 these dreams, though he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I
4383 think, with the riddle of his existence. At such times it had been
4384 Wendy’s custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap,
4385 soothing him in dear ways of her own invention, and when he grew calmer
4386 to put him back to bed before he quite woke up, so that he should
4387 not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him. But on this
4388 occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One arm dropped
4389 over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part of
4390 his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the little
4391 pearls.
4392 
4393 Thus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the tree
4394 looking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of compassion
4395 disturb his sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he loved flowers
4396 (I have been told) and sweet music (he was himself no mean performer on
4397 the harpsichord); and, let it be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of
4398 the scene stirred him profoundly. Mastered by his better self he would
4399 have returned reluctantly up the tree, but for one thing.
4400 
4401 What stayed him was Peter’s impertinent appearance as he slept. The
4402 open mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a
4403 personification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again, one
4404 may hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness. They
4405 steeled Hook’s heart. If his rage had broken him into a hundred pieces
4406 every one of them would have disregarded the incident, and leapt at the
4407 sleeper.
4408 
4409 Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in
4410 darkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered
4411 an obstacle, the door of Slightly’s tree. It did not entirely fill the
4412 aperture, and he had been looking over it. Feeling for the catch,
4413 he found to his fury that it was low down, beyond his reach. To his
4414 disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter’s
4415 face and figure visibly increased, and he rattled the door and flung
4416 himself against it. Was his enemy to escape him after all?
4417 
4418 But what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter’s
4419 medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it was
4420 straightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.
4421 
4422 Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a
4423 dreadful drug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that
4424 had come into his possession. These he had boiled down into a yellow
4425 liquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent
4426 poison in existence.
4427 
4428 Five drops of this he now added to Peter’s cup. His hand shook, but it
4429 was in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided glancing
4430 at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely to avoid
4431 spilling. Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim, and
4432 turning, wormed his way with difficulty up the tree. As he emerged
4433 at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole.
4434 Donning his hat at its most rakish angle, he wound his cloak around him,
4435 holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night,
4436 of which it was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to himself,
4437 stole away through the trees.
4438 
4439 Peter slept on. The light guttered [burned to edges] and went out,
4440 leaving the tenement in darkness; but still he slept. It must have been
4441 not less than ten o’clock by the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in
4442 his bed, wakened by he knew not what. It was a soft cautious tapping on
4443 the door of his tree.
4444 
4445 Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt for
4446 his dagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.
4447 
4448 “Who is that?”
4449 
4450 For long there was no answer: then again the knock.
4451 
4452 “Who are you?”
4453 
4454 No answer.
4455 
4456 He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled. In two strides he reached
4457 the door. Unlike Slightly’s door, it filled the aperture [opening], so
4458 that he could not see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him.
4459 
4460 “I won’t open unless you speak,” Peter cried.
4461 
4462 Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.
4463 
4464 “Let me in, Peter.”
4465 
4466 It was Tink, and quickly he unbarred to her. She flew in excitedly, her
4467 face flushed and her dress stained with mud.
4468 
4469 “What is it?”
4470 
4471 “Oh, you could never guess!” she cried, and offered him three guesses.
4472 “Out with it!” he shouted, and in one ungrammatical sentence, as long as
4473 the ribbons that conjurers [magicians] pull from their mouths, she told
4474 of the capture of Wendy and the boys.
4475 
4476 Peter’s heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on the
4477 pirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!
4478 
4479 “I’ll rescue her!” he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he leapt he
4480 thought of something he could do to please her. He could take his
4481 medicine.
4482 
4483 His hand closed on the fatal draught.
4484 
4485 “No!” shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as
4486 he sped through the forest.
4487 
4488 “Why not?”
4489 
4490 “It is poisoned.”
4491 
4492 “Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?”
4493 
4494 “Hook.”
4495 
4496 “Don’t be silly. How could Hook have got down here?”
4497 
4498 Alas, Tinker Bell could not explain this, for even she did not know the
4499 dark secret of Slightly’s tree. Nevertheless Hook’s words had left no
4500 room for doubt. The cup was poisoned.
4501 
4502 “Besides,” said Peter, quite believing himself, “I never fell asleep.”
4503 
4504 He raised the cup. No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one
4505 of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught,
4506 and drained it to the dregs.
4507 
4508 “Why, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine?”
4509 
4510 But she did not answer. Already she was reeling in the air.
4511 
4512 “What is the matter with you?” cried Peter, suddenly afraid.
4513 
4514 “It was poisoned, Peter,” she told him softly; “and now I am going to be
4515 dead.”
4516 
4517 “O Tink, did you drink it to save me?”
4518 
4519 “Yes.”
4520 
4521 “But why, Tink?”
4522 
4523 Her wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she alighted on his
4524 shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite. She whispered in his ear “You
4525 silly ass,” and then, tottering to her chamber, lay down on the bed.
4526 
4527 His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt
4528 near her in distress. Every moment her light was growing fainter; and
4529 he knew that if it went out she would be no more. She liked his tears so
4530 much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it.
4531 
4532 Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said.
4533 Then he made it out. She was saying that she thought she could get well
4534 again if children believed in fairies.
4535 
4536 Peter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it was night
4537 time; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland, and
4538 who were therefore nearer to him than you think: boys and girls in their
4539 nighties, and naked papooses in their baskets hung from trees.
4540 
4541 “Do you believe?” he cried.
4542 
4543 Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.
4544 
4545 She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she
4546 wasn’t sure.
4547 
4548 “What do you think?” she asked Peter.
4549 
4550 “If you believe,” he shouted to them, “clap your hands; don’t let Tink
4551 die.”
4552 
4553 Many clapped.
4554 
4555 Some didn’t.
4556 
4557 A few beasts hissed.
4558 
4559 The clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to
4560 their nurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink was
4561 saved. First her voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed, then
4562 she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever. She
4563 never thought of thanking those who believed, but she would have liked to
4564 get at the ones who had hissed.
4565 
4566 “And now to rescue Wendy!”
4567 
4568 The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree,
4569 begirt [belted] with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon
4570 his perilous quest. It was not such a night as he would have chosen.
4571 He had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing
4572 unwonted should escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have
4573 flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus
4574 disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.
4575 
4576 He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange
4577 names that they are very wild and difficult of approach.
4578 
4579 There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at
4580 which happily he was an adept [expert]. But in what direction, for he
4581 could not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship? A
4582 light fall of snow had obliterated all footmarks; and a deathly silence
4583 pervaded the island, as if for a space Nature stood still in horror of
4584 the recent carnage. He had taught the children something of the forest
4585 lore that he had himself learned from Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell,
4586 and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it.
4587 Slightly, if he had an opportunity, would blaze [cut a mark in] the
4588 trees, for instance, Curly would drop seeds, and Wendy would leave her
4589 handkerchief at some important place. The morning was needed to search
4590 for such guidance, and he could not wait. The upper world had called
4591 him, but would give no help.
4592 
4593 The crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound, not
4594 a movement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next
4595 tree, or stalking him from behind.
4596 
4597 He swore this terrible oath: “Hook or me this time.”
4598 
4599 Now he crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he darted across
4600 a space on which the moonlight played, one finger on his lip and his
4601 dagger at the ready. He was frightfully happy.
4602 
4603 
4604 
4605 
4606 Chapter 14 THE PIRATE SHIP
4607 
4608 One green light squinting over Kidd’s Creek, which is near the mouth of
4609 the pirate river, marked where the brig, the JOLLY ROGER, lay, low in
4610 the water; a rakish-looking [speedy-looking] craft foul to the hull,
4611 every beam in her detestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers.
4612 She was the cannibal of the seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye,
4613 for she floated immune in the horror of her name.
4614 
4615 She was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from her
4616 could have reached the shore. There was little sound, and none agreeable
4617 save the whir of the ship’s sewing machine at which Smee sat, ever
4618 industrious and obliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic Smee.
4619 I know not why he was so infinitely pathetic, unless it were because
4620 he was so pathetically unaware of it; but even strong men had to turn
4621 hastily from looking at him, and more than once on summer evenings he
4622 had touched the fount of Hook’s tears and made it flow. Of this, as of
4623 almost everything else, Smee was quite unconscious.
4624 
4625 A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma
4626 [putrid mist] of the night; others sprawled by barrels over games of
4627 dice and cards; and the exhausted four who had carried the little house
4628 lay prone on the deck, where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully
4629 to this side or that out of Hook’s reach, lest he should claw them
4630 mechanically in passing.
4631 
4632 Hook trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his hour of
4633 triumph. Peter had been removed for ever from his path, and all the
4634 other boys were in the brig, about to walk the plank. It was his
4635 grimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue to heel; and
4636 knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man, could we be surprised
4637 had he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by the winds of his
4638 success?
4639 
4640 But there was no elation in his gait, which kept pace with the action of
4641 his sombre mind. Hook was profoundly dejected.
4642 
4643 He was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the
4644 quietude of the night. It was because he was so terribly alone. This
4645 inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs.
4646 They were socially inferior to him.
4647 
4648 Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at
4649 this date set the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the
4650 lines must already have guessed, he had been at a famous public school;
4651 and its traditions still clung to him like garments, with which indeed
4652 they are largely concerned. Thus it was offensive to him even now to
4653 board a ship in the same dress in which he grappled [attacked] her, and
4654 he still adhered in his walk to the school’s distinguished slouch. But
4655 above all he retained the passion for good form.
4656 
4657 Good form! However much he may have degenerated, he still knew that this
4658 is all that really matters.
4659 
4660 From far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and through
4661 them came a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when one
4662 cannot sleep. “Have you been good form to-day?” was their eternal
4663 question.
4664 
4665 “Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine,” he cried.
4666 
4667 “Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?” the tap-tap
4668 from his school replied.
4669 
4670 “I am the only man whom Barbecue feared,” he urged, “and Flint feared
4671 Barbecue.”
4672 
4673 “Barbecue, Flint--what house?” came the cutting retort.
4674 
4675 Most disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think about
4676 good form?
4677 
4678 His vitals were tortured by this problem. It was a claw within him
4679 sharper than the iron one; and as it tore him, the perspiration dripped
4680 down his tallow [waxy] countenance and streaked his doublet. Ofttimes he
4681 drew his sleeve across his face, but there was no damming that trickle.
4682 
4683 Ah, envy not Hook.
4684 
4685 There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution [death]. It
4686 was as if Peter’s terrible oath had boarded the ship. Hook felt a gloomy
4687 desire to make his dying speech, lest presently there should be no time
4688 for it.
4689 
4690 “Better for Hook,” he cried, “if he had had less ambition!” It was in
4691 his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person.
4692 
4693 “No little children to love me!”
4694 
4695 Strange that he should think of this, which had never troubled him
4696 before; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind. For long he
4697 muttered to himself, staring at Smee, who was hemming placidly, under
4698 the conviction that all children feared him.
4699 
4700 Feared him! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig that
4701 night who did not already love him. He had said horrid things to them
4702 and hit them with the palm of his hand, because he could not hit with
4703 his fist, but they had only clung to him the more. Michael had tried on
4704 his spectacles.
4705 
4706 To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable! Hook itched to do it,
4707 but it seemed too brutal. Instead, he revolved this mystery in his
4708 mind: why do they find Smee lovable? He pursued the problem like the
4709 sleuth-hound that he was. If Smee was lovable, what was it that made him
4710 so? A terrible answer suddenly presented itself--“Good form?”
4711 
4712 Had the bo’sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form of
4713 all?
4714 
4715 He remembered that you have to prove you don’t know you have it before
4716 you are eligible for Pop [an elite social club at Eton].
4717 
4718 With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee’s head; but he did
4719 not tear. What arrested him was this reflection:
4720 
4721 “To claw a man because he is good form, what would that be?”
4722 
4723 “Bad form!”
4724 
4725 The unhappy Hook was as impotent [powerless] as he was damp, and he fell
4726 forward like a cut flower.
4727 
4728 His dogs thinking him out of the way for a time, discipline instantly
4729 relaxed; and they broke into a bacchanalian [drunken] dance, which
4730 brought him to his feet at once, all traces of human weakness gone, as
4731 if a bucket of water had passed over him.
4732 
4733 “Quiet, you scugs,” he cried, “or I’ll cast anchor in you;” and at once
4734 the din was hushed. “Are all the children chained, so that they cannot
4735 fly away?”
4736 
4737 “Ay, ay.”
4738 
4739 “Then hoist them up.”
4740 
4741 The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except Wendy,
4742 and ranged in line in front of him. For a time he seemed unconscious
4743 of their presence. He lolled at his ease, humming, not unmelodiously,
4744 snatches of a rude song, and fingering a pack of cards. Ever and anon
4745 the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face.
4746 
4747 “Now then, bullies,” he said briskly, “six of you walk the plank
4748 to-night, but I have room for two cabin boys. Which of you is it to be?”
4749 
4750 “Don’t irritate him unnecessarily,” had been Wendy’s instructions in
4751 the hold; so Tootles stepped forward politely. Tootles hated the idea
4752 of signing under such a man, but an instinct told him that it would
4753 be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a
4754 somewhat silly boy, he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be
4755 the buffer. All children know this about mothers, and despise them for
4756 it, but make constant use of it.
4757 
4758 So Tootles explained prudently, “You see, sir, I don’t think my mother
4759 would like me to be a pirate. Would your mother like you to be a pirate,
4760 Slightly?”
4761 
4762 He winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, “I don’t think so,” as if
4763 he wished things had been otherwise. “Would your mother like you to be a
4764 pirate, Twin?”
4765 
4766 “I don’t think so,” said the first twin, as clever as the others. “Nibs,
4767 would--”
4768 
4769 “Stow this gab,” roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back. “You,
4770 boy,” he said, addressing John, “you look as if you had a little pluck
4771 in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, my hearty?”
4772 
4773 Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep.; and
4774 he was struck by Hook’s picking him out.
4775 
4776 “I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,” he said diffidently.
4777 
4778 “And a good name too. We’ll call you that here, bully, if you join.”
4779 
4780 “What do you think, Michael?” asked John.
4781 
4782 “What would you call me if I join?” Michael demanded.
4783 
4784 “Blackbeard Joe.”
4785 
4786 Michael was naturally impressed. “What do you think, John?” He wanted
4787 John to decide, and John wanted him to decide.
4788 
4789 “Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King?” John inquired.
4790 
4791 Through Hook’s teeth came the answer: “You would have to swear, ‘Down
4792 with the King.’”
4793 
4794 Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far, but he shone out now.
4795 
4796 “Then I refuse,” he cried, banging the barrel in front of Hook.
4797 
4798 “And I refuse,” cried Michael.
4799 
4800 “Rule Britannia!” squeaked Curly.
4801 
4802 The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth; and Hook roared out,
4803 “That seals your doom. Bring up their mother. Get the plank ready.”
4804 
4805 They were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco
4806 preparing the fatal plank. But they tried to look brave when Wendy was
4807 brought up.
4808 
4809 No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates. To the
4810 boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling; but all that
4811 she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years. There was not
4812 a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with
4813 your finger “Dirty pig”; and she had already written it on several. But
4814 as the boys gathered round her she had no thought, of course, save for
4815 them.
4816 
4817 “So, my beauty,” said Hook, as if he spoke in syrup, “you are to see
4818 your children walk the plank.”
4819 
4820 Fine gentlemen though he was, the intensity of his communings had soiled
4821 his ruff, and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it. With a hasty
4822 gesture he tried to hide it, but he was too late.
4823 
4824 “Are they to die?” asked Wendy, with a look of such frightful contempt
4825 that he nearly fainted.
4826 
4827 “They are,” he snarled. “Silence all,” he called gloatingly, “for a
4828 mother’s last words to her children.”
4829 
4830 At this moment Wendy was grand. “These are my last words, dear boys,”
4831  she said firmly. “I feel that I have a message to you from your real
4832 mothers, and it is this: ‘We hope our sons will die like English
4833 gentlemen.’”
4834 
4835 Even the pirates were awed, and Tootles cried out hysterically, “I am
4836 going to do what my mother hopes. What are you to do, Nibs?”
4837 
4838 “What my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin?”
4839 
4840 “What my mother hopes. John, what are--”
4841 
4842 But Hook had found his voice again.
4843 
4844 “Tie her up!” he shouted.
4845 
4846 It was Smee who tied her to the mast. “See here, honey,” he whispered,
4847 “I’ll save you if you promise to be my mother.”
4848 
4849 But not even for Smee would she make such a promise. “I would almost
4850 rather have no children at all,” she said disdainfully [scornfully].
4851 
4852 It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to
4853 the mast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk they
4854 were about to take. They were no longer able to hope that they would
4855 walk it manfully, for the capacity to think had gone from them; they
4856 could stare and shiver only.
4857 
4858 Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step toward Wendy.
4859 His intention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys
4860 walking the plank one by one. But he never reached her, he never heard
4861 the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her. He heard something else
4862 instead.
4863 
4864 It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.
4865 
4866 They all heard it--pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every head was
4867 blown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound proceeded, but
4868 toward Hook. All knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone,
4869 and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators.
4870 
4871 Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him. It was as if
4872 he had been clipped at every joint. He fell in a little heap.
4873 
4874 The sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this ghastly
4875 thought, “The crocodile is about to board the ship!”
4876 
4877 Even the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic
4878 part of what the attacking force wanted. Left so fearfully alone, any
4879 other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell: but the
4880 gigantic brain of Hook was still working, and under its guidance he
4881 crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as he could
4882 go. The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him, and it was only
4883 when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke.
4884 
4885 “Hide me!” he cried hoarsely.
4886 
4887 They gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was coming
4888 aboard. They had no thought of fighting it. It was Fate.
4889 
4890 Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of
4891 the boys so that they could rush to the ship’s side to see the crocodile
4892 climbing it. Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of
4893 Nights; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid. It was
4894 Peter.
4895 
4896 He signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might
4897 rouse suspicion. Then he went on ticking.
4898 
4899 
4900 
4901 
4902 Chapter 15 “HOOK OR ME THIS TIME”
4903 
4904 Odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our
4905 noticing for a time that they have happened. Thus, to take an instance,
4906 we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we don’t know
4907 how long, but, say, half an hour. Now such an experience had come that
4908 night to Peter. When last we saw him he was stealing across the island
4909 with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready. He had seen the
4910 crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it, but by
4911 and by he remembered that it had not been ticking. At first he thought
4912 this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down.
4913 
4914 Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a
4915 fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter
4916 began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use;
4917 and he decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe he was the
4918 crocodile and let him pass unmolested. He ticked superbly, but with one
4919 unforeseen result. The crocodile was among those who heard the sound,
4920 and it followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what
4921 it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again
4922 ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a
4923 fixed idea, it was a stupid beast.
4924 
4925 Peter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legs
4926 encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new
4927 element. Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human
4928 of whom I know. As he swam he had but one thought: “Hook or me this
4929 time.” He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing
4930 that he was doing it. Had he known he would have stopped, for to board
4931 the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred
4932 to him.
4933 
4934 On the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a
4935 mouse; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with Hook
4936 in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile.
4937 
4938 The crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the
4939 ticking. At first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile,
4940 and he looked behind him swiftly. Then he realised that he was doing it
4941 himself, and in a flash he understood the situation. “How clever of me!”
4942  he thought at once, and signed to the boys not to burst into applause.
4943 
4944 It was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from the
4945 forecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what happened by
4946 your watch. Peter struck true and deep. John clapped his hands on the
4947 ill-fated pirate’s mouth to stifle the dying groan. He fell forward.
4948 Four boys caught him to prevent the thud. Peter gave the signal, and the
4949 carrion was cast overboard. There was a splash, and then silence. How
4950 long has it taken?
4951 
4952 “One!” (Slightly had begun to count.)
4953 
4954 None too soon, Peter, every inch of him on tiptoe, vanished into the
4955 cabin; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look
4956 round. They could hear each other’s distressed breathing now, which
4957 showed them that the more terrible sound had passed.
4958 
4959 “It’s gone, captain,” Smee said, wiping off his spectacles. “All’s still
4960 again.”
4961 
4962 Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff, and listened so intently
4963 that he could have caught the echo of the tick. There was not a sound,
4964 and he drew himself up firmly to his full height.
4965 
4966 “Then here’s to Johnny Plank!” he cried brazenly, hating the boys more
4967 than ever because they had seen him unbend. He broke into the villainous
4968 ditty:
4969 
4970      “Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank,
4971      You walks along it so,
4972      Till it goes down and you goes down
4973      To Davy Jones below!”
4974 
4975 To terrorize the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of
4976 dignity, he danced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at them as he
4977 sang; and when he finished he cried, “Do you want a touch of the cat [o’
4978 nine tails] before you walk the plank?”
4979 
4980 At that they fell on their knees. “No, no!” they cried so piteously that
4981 every pirate smiled.
4982 
4983 “Fetch the cat, Jukes,” said Hook; “it’s in the cabin.”
4984 
4985 The cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other.
4986 
4987 “Ay, ay,” said Jukes blithely, and he strode into the cabin. They
4988 followed him with their eyes; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his
4989 song, his dogs joining in with him:
4990 
4991      “Yo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat,
4992      Its tails are nine, you know,
4993      And when they’re writ upon your back--”
4994 
4995 What was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song was
4996 stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin. It wailed through the ship,
4997 and died away. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood
4998 by the boys, but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech.
4999 
5000 “What was that?” cried Hook.
5001 
5002 “Two,” said Slightly solemnly.
5003 
5004 The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin.
5005 He tottered out, haggard.
5006 
5007 “What’s the matter with Bill Jukes, you dog?” hissed Hook, towering over
5008 him.
5009 
5010 “The matter wi’ him is he’s dead, stabbed,” replied Cecco in a hollow
5011 voice.
5012 
5013 “Bill Jukes dead!” cried the startled pirates.
5014 
5015 “The cabin’s as black as a pit,” Cecco said, almost gibbering, “but
5016 there is something terrible in there: the thing you heard crowing.”
5017 
5018 The exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both were
5019 seen by Hook.
5020 
5021 “Cecco,” he said in his most steely voice, “go back and fetch me out
5022 that doodle-doo.”
5023 
5024 Cecco, bravest of the brave, cowered before his captain, crying “No,
5025 no”; but Hook was purring to his claw.
5026 
5027 “Did you say you would go, Cecco?” he said musingly.
5028 
5029 Cecco went, first flinging his arms despairingly. There was no more
5030 singing, all listened now; and again came a death-screech and again a
5031 crow.
5032 
5033 No one spoke except Slightly. “Three,” he said.
5034 
5035 Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture. “‘S’death and odds fish,” he
5036 thundered, “who is to bring me that doodle-doo?”
5037 
5038 “Wait till Cecco comes out,” growled Starkey, and the others took up the
5039 cry.
5040 
5041 “I think I heard you volunteer, Starkey,” said Hook, purring again.
5042 
5043 “No, by thunder!” Starkey cried.
5044 
5045 “My hook thinks you did,” said Hook, crossing to him. “I wonder if it
5046 would not be advisable, Starkey, to humour the hook?”
5047 
5048 “I’ll swing before I go in there,” replied Starkey doggedly, and again
5049 he had the support of the crew.
5050 
5051 “Is this mutiny?” asked Hook more pleasantly than ever. “Starkey’s
5052 ringleader!”
5053 
5054 “Captain, mercy!” Starkey whimpered, all of a tremble now.
5055 
5056 “Shake hands, Starkey,” said Hook, proffering his claw.
5057 
5058 Starkey looked round for help, but all deserted him. As he backed up
5059 Hook advanced, and now the red spark was in his eye. With a despairing
5060 scream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the
5061 sea.
5062 
5063 “Four,” said Slightly.
5064 
5065 “And now,” Hook said courteously, “did any other gentlemen say mutiny?”
5066  Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture, “I’ll
5067 bring out that doodle-doo myself,” he said, and sped into the cabin.
5068 
5069 “Five.” How Slightly longed to say it. He wetted his lips to be ready,
5070 but Hook came staggering out, without his lantern.
5071 
5072 “Something blew out the light,” he said a little unsteadily.
5073 
5074 “Something!” echoed Mullins.
5075 
5076 “What of Cecco?” demanded Noodler.
5077 
5078 “He’s as dead as Jukes,” said Hook shortly.
5079 
5080 His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably,
5081 and the mutinous sounds again broke forth. All pirates are
5082 superstitious, and Cookson cried, “They do say the surest sign a ship’s
5083 accurst is when there’s one on board more than can be accounted for.”
5084 
5085 “I’ve heard,” muttered Mullins, “he always boards the pirate craft last.
5086 Had he a tail, captain?”
5087 
5088 “They say,” said another, looking viciously at Hook, “that when he comes
5089 it’s in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard.”
5090 
5091 “Had he a hook, captain?” asked Cookson insolently; and one after
5092 another took up the cry, “The ship’s doomed!” At this the children could
5093 not resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh forgotten his prisoners,
5094 but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again.
5095 
5096 “Lads,” he cried to his crew, “now here’s a notion. Open the cabin door
5097 and drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives. If
5098 they kill him, we’re so much the better; if he kills them, we’re none
5099 the worse.”
5100 
5101 For the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did his
5102 bidding. The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin
5103 and the door was closed on them.
5104 
5105 “Now, listen!” cried Hook, and all listened. But not one dared to face
5106 the door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound to the mast.
5107 It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching, it was for
5108 the reappearance of Peter.
5109 
5110 She had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing for which
5111 he had gone in search: the key that would free the children of their
5112 manacles, and now they all stole forth, armed with such weapons as they
5113 could find. First signing them to hide, Peter cut Wendy’s bonds,
5114 and then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off
5115 together; but one thing barred the way, an oath, “Hook or me this time.”
5116  So when he had freed Wendy, he whispered for her to conceal herself with
5117 the others, and himself took her place by the mast, her cloak around him
5118 so that he should pass for her. Then he took a great breath and crowed.
5119 
5120 To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the
5121 cabin; and they were panic-stricken. Hook tried to hearten them; but
5122 like the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs, and he knew
5123 that if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him.
5124 
5125 “Lads,” he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never
5126 quailing for an instant, “I’ve thought it out. There’s a Jonah aboard.”
5127 
5128 “Ay,” they snarled, “a man wi’ a hook.”
5129 
5130 “No, lads, no, it’s the girl. Never was luck on a pirate ship wi’ a
5131 woman on board. We’ll right the ship when she’s gone.”
5132 
5133 Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint’s. “It’s
5134 worth trying,” they said doubtfully.
5135 
5136 “Fling the girl overboard,” cried Hook; and they made a rush at the
5137 figure in the cloak.
5138 
5139 “There’s none can save you now, missy,” Mullins hissed jeeringly.
5140 
5141 “There’s one,” replied the figure.
5142 
5143 “Who’s that?”
5144 
5145 “Peter Pan the avenger!” came the terrible answer; and as he spoke Peter
5146 flung off his cloak. Then they all knew who ‘twas that had been undoing
5147 them in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he failed.
5148 In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke.
5149 
5150 At last he cried, “Cleave him to the brisket!” but without conviction.
5151 
5152 “Down, boys, and at them!” Peter’s voice rang out; and in another moment
5153 the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had the pirates kept
5154 together it is certain that they would have won; but the onset came
5155 when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and thither, striking
5156 wildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew. Man to man
5157 they were the stronger; but they fought on the defensive only, which
5158 enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry. Some of the
5159 miscreants leapt into the sea; others hid in dark recesses, where they
5160 were found by Slightly, who did not fight, but ran about with a lantern
5161 which he flashed in their faces, so that they were half blinded and
5162 fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys. There was
5163 little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons, an occasional
5164 screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously counting--five--six--seven
5165 eight--nine--ten--eleven.
5166 
5167 I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who
5168 seemed to have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in that circle
5169 of fire. They had done for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a
5170 match for them all. Again and again they closed upon him, and again and
5171 again he hewed a clear space. He had lifted up one boy with his hook,
5172 and was using him as a buckler [shield], when another, who had just
5173 passed his sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.
5174 
5175 “Put up your swords, boys,” cried the newcomer, “this man is mine.”
5176 
5177 Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The others
5178 drew back and formed a ring around them.
5179 
5180 For long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering
5181 slightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face.
5182 
5183 “So, Pan,” said Hook at last, “this is all your doing.”
5184 
5185 “Ay, James Hook,” came the stern answer, “it is all my doing.”
5186 
5187 “Proud and insolent youth,” said Hook, “prepare to meet thy doom.”
5188 
5189 “Dark and sinister man,” Peter answered, “have at thee.”
5190 
5191 Without more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage
5192 to either blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with dazzling
5193 rapidity; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got
5194 past his foe’s defence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead,
5195 and he could not drive the steel home. Hook, scarcely his inferior in
5196 brilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced him back by
5197 the weight of his onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite
5198 thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his astonishment
5199 he found this thrust turned aside again and again. Then he sought to
5200 close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this time had
5201 been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging fiercely,
5202 pierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose peculiar
5203 colour, you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell from Hook’s
5204 hand, and he was at Peter’s mercy.
5205 
5206 “Now!” cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited
5207 his opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly, but with a
5208 tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.
5209 
5210 Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but darker
5211 suspicions assailed him now.
5212 
5213 “Pan, who and what art thou?” he cried huskily.
5214 
5215 “I’m youth, I’m joy,” Peter answered at a venture, “I’m a little bird
5216 that has broken out of the egg.”
5217 
5218 This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that
5219 Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very
5220 pinnacle of good form.
5221 
5222 “To’t again,” he cried despairingly.
5223 
5224 He fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible sword
5225 would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but Peter
5226 fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the
5227 danger zone. And again and again he darted in and pricked.
5228 
5229 Hook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer
5230 asked for life; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form
5231 before it was cold forever.
5232 
5233 Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it.
5234 
5235 “In two minutes,” he cried, “the ship will be blown to pieces.”
5236 
5237 Now, now, he thought, true form will show.
5238 
5239 But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands,
5240 and calmly flung it overboard.
5241 
5242 What sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though he was,
5243 we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end he was
5244 true to the traditions of his race. The other boys were flying around
5245 him now, flouting, scornful; and he staggered about the deck striking up
5246 at them impotently, his mind was no longer with them; it was slouching
5247 in the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up [to the headmaster]
5248 for good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall. And his shoes
5249 were right, and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his
5250 socks were right.
5251 
5252 James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.
5253 
5254 For we have come to his last moment.
5255 
5256 Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger
5257 poised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He
5258 did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely
5259 stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him: a little mark
5260 of respect from us at the end.
5261 
5262 He had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him. As he
5263 stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through
5264 the air, he invited him with a gesture to use his foot. It made Peter
5265 kick instead of stab.
5266 
5267 At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved.
5268 
5269 “Bad form,” he cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile.
5270 
5271 Thus perished James Hook.
5272 
5273 “Seventeen,” Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in his
5274 figures. Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night; but two
5275 reached the shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins, who made him
5276 nurse for all their papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate; and
5277 Smee, who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles, making
5278 a precarious living by saying he was the only man that Jas. Hook had
5279 feared.
5280 
5281 Wendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though
5282 watching Peter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she
5283 became prominent again. She praised them equally, and shuddered
5284 delightfully when Michael showed her the place where he had killed one;
5285 and then she took them into Hook’s cabin and pointed to his watch which
5286 was hanging on a nail. It said “half-past one!”
5287 
5288 The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. She got
5289 them to bed in the pirates’ bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure; all
5290 but Peter, who strutted up and down on the deck, until at last he fell
5291 asleep by the side of Long Tom. He had one of his dreams that night, and
5292 cried in his sleep for a long time, and Wendy held him tightly.
5293 
5294 
5295 
5296 
5297 Chapter 16 THE RETURN HOME
5298 
5299 By three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps [legs];
5300 for there was a big sea running; and Tootles, the bo’sun, was among
5301 them, with a rope’s end in his hand and chewing tobacco. They all donned
5302 pirate clothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly, and tumbled up, with
5303 the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers.
5304 
5305 It need not be said who was the captain. Nibs and John were first and
5306 second mate. There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars [sailors]
5307 before the mast, and lived in the fo’c’sle. Peter had already lashed
5308 himself to the wheel; but he piped all hands and delivered a short
5309 address to them; said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant
5310 hearties, but that he knew they were the scum of Rio and the Gold Coast,
5311 and if they snapped at him he would tear them. The bluff strident words
5312 struck the note sailors understood, and they cheered him lustily. Then
5313 a few sharp orders were given, and they turned the ship round, and nosed
5314 her for the mainland.
5315 
5316 Captain Pan calculated, after consulting the ship’s chart, that if this
5317 weather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June,
5318 after which it would save time to fly.
5319 
5320 Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour
5321 of keeping it a pirate; but the captain treated them as dogs, and they
5322 dared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin [one person
5323 after another, as they had to Cpt. Hook]. Instant obedience was the only
5324 safe thing. Slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take
5325 soundings. The general feeling was that Peter was honest just now to
5326 lull Wendy’s suspicions, but that there might be a change when the new
5327 suit was ready, which, against her will, she was making for him out of
5328 some of Hook’s wickedest garments. It was afterwards whispered among
5329 them that on the first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin
5330 with Hook’s cigar-holder in his mouth and one hand clenched, all but for
5331 the forefinger, which he bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook.
5332 
5333 Instead of watching the ship, however, we must now return to that
5334 desolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless
5335 flight so long ago. It seems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this
5336 time; and yet we may be sure that Mrs. Darling does not blame us. If we
5337 had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her, she would
5338 probably have cried, “Don’t be silly; what do I matter? Do go back and
5339 keep an eye on the children.” So long as mothers are like this their
5340 children will take advantage of them; and they may lay to [bet on] that.
5341 
5342 Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful
5343 occupants are on their way home; we are merely hurrying on in advance
5344 of them to see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs.
5345 Darling do not go out for the evening. We are no more than servants. Why
5346 on earth should their beds be properly aired, seeing that they left them
5347 in such a thankless hurry? Would it not serve them jolly well right if
5348 they came back and found that their parents were spending the week-end
5349 in the country? It would be the moral lesson they have been in need
5350 of ever since we met them; but if we contrived things in this way Mrs.
5351 Darling would never forgive us.
5352 
5353 One thing I should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her, in the
5354 way authors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed they
5355 will be here on Thursday week. This would spoil so completely the
5356 surprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are looking forward. They
5357 have been planning it out on the ship: mother’s rapture, father’s shout
5358 of joy, Nana’s leap through the air to embrace them first, when what
5359 they ought to be prepared for is a good hiding. How delicious to spoil
5360 it all by breaking the news in advance; so that when they enter grandly
5361 Mrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy her mouth, and Mr. Darling may
5362 exclaim pettishly, “Dash it all, here are those boys again.” However,
5363 we should get no thanks even for this. We are beginning to know Mrs.
5364 Darling by this time, and may be sure that she would upbraid us for
5365 depriving the children of their little pleasure.
5366 
5367 “But, my dear madam, it is ten days till Thursday week; so that by
5368 telling you what’s what, we can save you ten days of unhappiness.”
5369 
5370 “Yes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten minutes of
5371 delight.”
5372 
5373 “Oh, if you look at it in that way!”
5374 
5375 “What other way is there in which to look at it?”
5376 
5377 You see, the woman had no proper spirit. I had meant to say
5378 extraordinarily nice things about her; but I despise her, and not one of
5379 them will I say now. She does not really need to be told to have things
5380 ready, for they are ready. All the beds are aired, and she never leaves
5381 the house, and observe, the window is open. For all the use we are to
5382 her, we might well go back to the ship. However, as we are here we may
5383 as well stay and look on. That is all we are, lookers-on. Nobody really
5384 wants us. So let us watch and say jaggy things, in the hope that some of
5385 them will hurt.
5386 
5387 The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine
5388 and six the kennel is no longer there. When the children flew away, Mr.
5389 Darling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for having chained
5390 Nana up, and that from first to last she had been wiser than he. Of
5391 course, as we have seen, he was quite a simple man; indeed he might have
5392 passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness off;
5393 but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion’s courage to do what
5394 seemed right to him; and having thought the matter out with anxious care
5395 after the flight of the children, he went down on all fours and crawled
5396 into the kennel. To all Mrs. Darling’s dear invitations to him to come
5397 out he replied sadly but firmly:
5398 
5399 “No, my own one, this is the place for me.”
5400 
5401 In the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave
5402 the kennel until his children came back. Of course this was a pity; but
5403 whatever Mr. Darling did he had to do in excess, otherwise he soon gave
5404 up doing it. And there never was a more humble man than the once proud
5405 George Darling, as he sat in the kennel of an evening talking with his
5406 wife of their children and all their pretty ways.
5407 
5408 Very touching was his deference to Nana. He would not let her come into
5409 the kennel, but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly.
5410 
5411 Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab,
5412 which conveyed him to his office, and he returned home in the same way
5413 at six. Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen
5414 if we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours: this
5415 man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention. Inwardly he
5416 must have suffered torture; but he preserved a calm exterior even when
5417 the young criticised his little home, and he always lifted his hat
5418 courteously to any lady who looked inside.
5419 
5420 It may have been Quixotic, but it was magnificent. Soon the inward
5421 meaning of it leaked out, and the great heart of the public was touched.
5422 Crowds followed the cab, cheering it lustily; charming girls scaled it
5423 to get his autograph; interviews appeared in the better class of papers,
5424 and society invited him to dinner and added, “Do come in the kennel.”
5425 
5426 On that eventful Thursday week, Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery
5427 awaiting George’s return home; a very sad-eyed woman. Now that we look
5428 at her closely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days, all gone
5429 now just because she has lost her babes, I find I won’t be able to say
5430 nasty things about her after all. If she was too fond of her rubbishy
5431 children, she couldn’t help it. Look at her in her chair, where she has
5432 fallen asleep. The corner of her mouth, where one looks first, is almost
5433 withered up. Her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she had a
5434 pain there. Some like Peter best, and some like Wendy best, but I like
5435 her best. Suppose, to make her happy, we whisper to her in her sleep
5436 that the brats are coming back. They are really within two miles of the
5437 window now, and flying strong, but all we need whisper is that they are
5438 on the way. Let’s.
5439 
5440 It is a pity we did it, for she has started up, calling their names; and
5441 there is no one in the room but Nana.
5442 
5443 “O Nana, I dreamt my dear ones had come back.”
5444 
5445 Nana had filmy eyes, but all she could do was put her paw gently on her
5446 mistress’s lap; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was
5447 brought back. As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife, we see
5448 that his face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression.
5449 
5450 He gave his hat to Liza, who took it scornfully; for she had no
5451 imagination, and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of
5452 such a man. Outside, the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were
5453 still cheering, and he was naturally not unmoved.
5454 
5455 “Listen to them,” he said; “it is very gratifying.”
5456 
5457 “Lots of little boys,” sneered Liza.
5458 
5459 “There were several adults to-day,” he assured her with a faint flush;
5460 but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her.
5461 Social success had not spoilt him; it had made him sweeter. For some
5462 time he sat with his head out of the kennel, talking with Mrs. Darling
5463 of this success, and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she
5464 hoped his head would not be turned by it.
5465 
5466 “But if I had been a weak man,” he said. “Good heavens, if I had been a
5467 weak man!”
5468 
5469 “And, George,” she said timidly, “you are as full of remorse as ever,
5470 aren’t you?”
5471 
5472 “Full of remorse as ever, dearest! See my punishment: living in a
5473 kennel.”
5474 
5475 “But it is punishment, isn’t it, George? You are sure you are not
5476 enjoying it?”
5477 
5478 “My love!”
5479 
5480 You may be sure she begged his pardon; and then, feeling drowsy, he
5481 curled round in the kennel.
5482 
5483 “Won’t you play me to sleep,” he asked, “on the nursery piano?” and as
5484 she was crossing to the day-nursery he added thoughtlessly, “And shut
5485 that window. I feel a draught.”
5486 
5487 “O George, never ask me to do that. The window must always be left open
5488 for them, always, always.”
5489 
5490 Now it was his turn to beg her pardon; and she went into the day-nursery
5491 and played, and soon he was asleep; and while he slept, Wendy and John
5492 and Michael flew into the room.
5493 
5494 Oh no. We have written it so, because that was the charming arrangement
5495 planned by them before we left the ship; but something must have
5496 happened since then, for it is not they who have flown in, it is Peter
5497 and Tinker Bell.
5498 
5499 Peter’s first words tell all.
5500 
5501 “Quick Tink,” he whispered, “close the window; bar it! That’s right. Now
5502 you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy comes she will think
5503 her mother has barred her out; and she will have to go back with me.”
5504 
5505 Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had
5506 exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink
5507 to escort the children to the mainland. This trick had been in his head
5508 all the time.
5509 
5510 Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then
5511 he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to
5512 Tink, “It’s Wendy’s mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as
5513 my mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my mother’s
5514 was.”
5515 
5516 Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother; but he sometimes
5517 bragged about her.
5518 
5519 He did not know the tune, which was “Home, Sweet Home,” but he knew it
5520 was saying, “Come back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy”; and he cried exultantly,
5521 “You will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window is barred!”
5522 
5523 He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now he saw
5524 that Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box, and that two tears were
5525 sitting on her eyes.
5526 
5527 “She wants me to unbar the window,” thought Peter, “but I won’t, not I!”
5528 
5529 He peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two had
5530 taken their place.
5531 
5532 “She’s awfully fond of Wendy,” he said to himself. He was angry with her
5533 now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy.
5534 
5535 The reason was so simple: “I’m fond of her too. We can’t both have her,
5536 lady.”
5537 
5538 But the lady would not make the best of it, and he was unhappy. He
5539 ceased to look at her, but even then she would not let go of him. He
5540 skipped about and made funny faces, but when he stopped it was just as
5541 if she were inside him, knocking.
5542 
5543 “Oh, all right,” he said at last, and gulped. Then he unbarred the
5544 window. “Come on, Tink,” he cried, with a frightful sneer at the laws of
5545 nature; “we don’t want any silly mothers;” and he flew away.
5546 
5547 Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after
5548 all, which of course was more than they deserved. They alighted on the
5549 floor, quite unashamed of themselves, and the youngest one had already
5550 forgotten his home.
5551 
5552 “John,” he said, looking around him doubtfully, “I think I have been
5553 here before.”
5554 
5555 “Of course you have, you silly. There is your old bed.”
5556 
5557 “So it is,” Michael said, but not with much conviction.
5558 
5559 “I say,” cried John, “the kennel!” and he dashed across to look into it.
5560 
5561 “Perhaps Nana is inside it,” Wendy said.
5562 
5563 But John whistled. “Hullo,” he said, “there’s a man inside it.”
5564 
5565 “It’s father!” exclaimed Wendy.
5566 
5567 “Let me see father,” Michael begged eagerly, and he took a good look.
5568 “He is not so big as the pirate I killed,” he said with such frank
5569 disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep; it would have been
5570 sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say.
5571 
5572 Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in
5573 the kennel.
5574 
5575 “Surely,” said John, like one who had lost faith in his memory, “he used
5576 not to sleep in the kennel?”
5577 
5578 “John,” Wendy said falteringly, “perhaps we don’t remember the old life
5579 as well as we thought we did.”
5580 
5581 A chill fell upon them; and serve them right.
5582 
5583 “It is very careless of mother,” said that young scoundrel John, “not to
5584 be here when we come back.”
5585 
5586 It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again.
5587 
5588 “It’s mother!” cried Wendy, peeping.
5589 
5590 “So it is!” said John.
5591 
5592 “Then are you not really our mother, Wendy?” asked Michael, who was
5593 surely sleepy.
5594 
5595 “Oh dear!” exclaimed Wendy, with her first real twinge of remorse [for
5596 having gone], “it was quite time we came back.”
5597 
5598 “Let us creep in,” John suggested, “and put our hands over her eyes.”
5599 
5600 But Wendy, who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently, had
5601 a better plan.
5602 
5603 “Let us all slip into our beds, and be there when she comes in, just as
5604 if we had never been away.”
5605 
5606 And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her
5607 husband was asleep, all the beds were occupied. The children waited
5608 for her cry of joy, but it did not come. She saw them, but she did not
5609 believe they were there. You see, she saw them in their beds so often in
5610 her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her
5611 still.
5612 
5613 She sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days she had
5614 nursed them.
5615 
5616 They could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three
5617 of them.
5618 
5619 “Mother!” Wendy cried.
5620 
5621 “That’s Wendy,” she said, but still she was sure it was the dream.
5622 
5623 “Mother!”
5624 
5625 “That’s John,” she said.
5626 
5627 “Mother!” cried Michael. He knew her now.
5628 
5629 “That’s Michael,” she said, and she stretched out her arms for the three
5630 little selfish children they would never envelop again. Yes, they did,
5631 they went round Wendy and John and Michael, who had slipped out of bed
5632 and run to her.
5633 
5634 “George, George!” she cried when she could speak; and Mr. Darling woke
5635 to share her bliss, and Nana came rushing in. There could not have been
5636 a lovelier sight; but there was none to see it except a little boy who
5637 was staring in at the window. He had had ecstasies innumerable that
5638 other children can never know; but he was looking through the window at
5639 the one joy from which he must be for ever barred.
5640 
5641 
5642 
5643 
5644 Chapter 17 WHEN WENDY GREW UP
5645 
5646 I hope you want to know what became of the other boys. They were waiting
5647 below to give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they had
5648 counted five hundred they went up. They went up by the stair, because
5649 they thought this would make a better impression. They stood in a row
5650 in front of Mrs. Darling, with their hats off, and wishing they were not
5651 wearing their pirate clothes. They said nothing, but their eyes asked
5652 her to have them. They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling also, but
5653 they forgot about him.
5654 
5655 Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them; but Mr.
5656 Darling was curiously depressed, and they saw that he considered six a
5657 rather large number.
5658 
5659 “I must say,” he said to Wendy, “that you don’t do things by halves,” a
5660 grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them.
5661 
5662 The first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, “Do you think
5663 we should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, we can go
5664 away.”
5665 
5666 “Father!” Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him. He knew
5667 he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it.
5668 
5669 “We could lie doubled up,” said Nibs.
5670 
5671 “I always cut their hair myself,” said Wendy.
5672 
5673 “George!” Mrs. Darling exclaimed, pained to see her dear one showing
5674 himself in such an unfavourable light.
5675 
5676 Then he burst into tears, and the truth came out. He was as glad to
5677 have them as she was, he said, but he thought they should have asked his
5678 consent as well as hers, instead of treating him as a cypher [zero] in
5679 his own house.
5680 
5681 “I don’t think he is a cypher,” Tootles cried instantly. “Do you think
5682 he is a cypher, Curly?”
5683 
5684 “No, I don’t. Do you think he is a cypher, Slightly?”
5685 
5686 “Rather not. Twin, what do you think?”
5687 
5688 It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher; and he was
5689 absurdly gratified, and said he would find space for them all in the
5690 drawing-room if they fitted in.
5691 
5692 “We’ll fit in, sir,” they assured him.
5693 
5694 “Then follow the leader,” he cried gaily. “Mind you, I am not sure that
5695 we have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it’s all the same.
5696 Hoop la!”
5697 
5698 He went off dancing through the house, and they all cried “Hoop la!” and
5699 danced after him, searching for the drawing-room; and I forget whether
5700 they found it, but at any rate they found corners, and they all fitted
5701 in.
5702 
5703 As for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he flew away. He did not
5704 exactly come to the window, but he brushed against it in passing so that
5705 she could open it if she liked and call to him. That is what she did.
5706 
5707 “Hullo, Wendy, good-bye,” he said.
5708 
5709 “Oh dear, are you going away?”
5710 
5711 “Yes.”
5712 
5713 “You don’t feel, Peter,” she said falteringly, “that you would like to
5714 say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject?”
5715 
5716 “No.”
5717 
5718 “About me, Peter?”
5719 
5720 “No.”
5721 
5722 Mrs. Darling came to the window, for at present she was keeping a sharp
5723 eye on Wendy. She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys,
5724 and would like to adopt him also.
5725 
5726 “Would you send me to school?” he inquired craftily.
5727 
5728 “Yes.”
5729 
5730 “And then to an office?”
5731 
5732 “I suppose so.”
5733 
5734 “Soon I would be a man?”
5735 
5736 “Very soon.”
5737 
5738 “I don’t want to go to school and learn solemn things,” he told her
5739 passionately. “I don’t want to be a man. O Wendy’s mother, if I was to
5740 wake up and feel there was a beard!”
5741 
5742 “Peter,” said Wendy the comforter, “I should love you in a beard;” and
5743 Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed her.
5744 
5745 “Keep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man.”
5746 
5747 “But where are you going to live?”
5748 
5749 “With Tink in the house we built for Wendy. The fairies are to put it
5750 high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights.”
5751 
5752 “How lovely,” cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened her
5753 grip.
5754 
5755 “I thought all the fairies were dead,” Mrs. Darling said.
5756 
5757 “There are always a lot of young ones,” explained Wendy, who was now
5758 quite an authority, “because you see when a new baby laughs for the
5759 first time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies there
5760 are always new fairies. They live in nests on the tops of trees; and the
5761 mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are
5762 just little sillies who are not sure what they are.”
5763 
5764 “I shall have such fun,” said Peter, with eye on Wendy.
5765 
5766 “It will be rather lonely in the evening,” she said, “sitting by the
5767 fire.”
5768 
5769 “I shall have Tink.”
5770 
5771 “Tink can’t go a twentieth part of the way round,” she reminded him a
5772 little tartly.
5773 
5774 “Sneaky tell-tale!” Tink called out from somewhere round the corner.
5775 
5776 “It doesn’t matter,” Peter said.
5777 
5778 “O Peter, you know it matters.”
5779 
5780 “Well, then, come with me to the little house.”
5781 
5782 “May I, mummy?”
5783 
5784 “Certainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep you.”
5785 
5786 “But he does so need a mother.”
5787 
5788 “So do you, my love.”
5789 
5790 “Oh, all right,” Peter said, as if he had asked her from politeness
5791 merely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she made this
5792 handsome offer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do
5793 his spring cleaning. Wendy would have preferred a more permanent
5794 arrangement; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming;
5795 but this promise sent Peter away quite gay again. He had no sense of
5796 time, and was so full of adventures that all I have told you about him
5797 is only a halfpenny-worth of them. I suppose it was because Wendy knew
5798 this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:
5799 
5800 “You won’t forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning time
5801 comes?”
5802 
5803 Of course Peter promised; and then he flew away. He took Mrs. Darling’s
5804 kiss with him. The kiss that had been for no one else, Peter took quite
5805 easily. Funny. But she seemed satisfied.
5806 
5807 Of course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class
5808 III, but Slightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V.
5809 Class I is the top class. Before they had attended school a week they
5810 saw what goats they had been not to remain on the island; but it was too
5811 late now, and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me
5812 or Jenkins minor [the younger Jenkins]. It is sad to have to say that
5813 the power to fly gradually left them. At first Nana tied their feet to
5814 the bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night; and one of
5815 their diversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses [the English
5816 double-deckers]; but by and by they ceased to tug at their bonds in bed,
5817 and found that they hurt themselves when they let go of the bus. In time
5818 they could not even fly after their hats. Want of practice, they called
5819 it; but what it really meant was that they no longer believed.
5820 
5821 Michael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him;
5822 so he was with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first
5823 year. She flew away with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves
5824 and berries in the Neverland, and her one fear was that he might notice
5825 how short it had become; but he never noticed, he had so much to say
5826 about himself.
5827 
5828 She had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times, but
5829 new adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind.
5830 
5831 “Who is Captain Hook?” he asked with interest when she spoke of the arch
5832 enemy.
5833 
5834 “Don’t you remember,” she asked, amazed, “how you killed him and saved
5835 all our lives?”
5836 
5837 “I forget them after I kill them,” he replied carelessly.
5838 
5839 When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see
5840 her he said, “Who is Tinker Bell?”
5841 
5842 “O Peter,” she said, shocked; but even when she explained he could not
5843 remember.
5844 
5845 “There are such a lot of them,” he said. “I expect she is no more.”
5846 
5847 I expect he was right, for fairies don’t live long, but they are so
5848 little that a short time seems a good while to them.
5849 
5850 Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday
5851 to Peter; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But he was
5852 exactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning in
5853 the little house on the tree tops.
5854 
5855 Next year he did not come for her. She waited in a new frock because the
5856 old one simply would not meet; but he never came.
5857 
5858 “Perhaps he is ill,” Michael said.
5859 
5860 “You know he is never ill.”
5861 
5862 Michael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, “Perhaps there
5863 is no such person, Wendy!” and then Wendy would have cried if Michael
5864 had not been crying.
5865 
5866 Peter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that he never
5867 knew he had missed a year.
5868 
5869 That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little longer
5870 she tried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was
5871 untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge. But the years
5872 came and went without bringing the careless boy; and when they met again
5873 Wendy was a married woman, and Peter was no more to her than a little
5874 dust in the box in which she had kept her toys. Wendy was grown up. You
5875 need not be sorry for her. She was one of the kind that likes to grow
5876 up. In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other
5877 girls.
5878 
5879 All the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely
5880 worth while saying anything more about them. You may see the twins and
5881 Nibs and Curly any day going to an office, each carrying a little bag
5882 and an umbrella. Michael is an engine-driver [train engineer]. Slightly
5883 married a lady of title, and so he became a lord. You see that judge in
5884 a wig coming out at the iron door? That used to be Tootles. The bearded
5885 man who doesn’t know any story to tell his children was once John.
5886 
5887 Wendy was married in white with a pink sash. It is strange to think
5888 that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns [formal
5889 announcement of a marriage].
5890 
5891 Years rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not to be
5892 written in ink but in a golden splash.
5893 
5894 She was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from
5895 the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions. When
5896 she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan. She
5897 loved to hear of Peter, and Wendy told her all she could remember in the
5898 very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place. It was
5899 Jane’s nursery now, for her father had bought it at the three per cents
5900 [mortgage rate] from Wendy’s father, who was no longer fond of stairs.
5901 Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten.
5902 
5903 There were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane’s and her nurse’s; and
5904 there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away. She died of old age,
5905 and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; being very
5906 firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except
5907 herself.
5908 
5909 Once a week Jane’s nurse had her evening off; and then it was Wendy’s
5910 part to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It was Jane’s
5911 invention to raise the sheet over her mother’s head and her own, thus
5912 making a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:
5913 
5914 “What do we see now?”
5915 
5916 “I don’t think I see anything to-night,” says Wendy, with a feeling that
5917 if Nana were here she would object to further conversation.
5918 
5919 “Yes, you do,” says Jane, “you see when you were a little girl.”
5920 
5921 “That is a long time ago, sweetheart,” says Wendy. “Ah me, how time
5922 flies!”
5923 
5924 “Does it fly,” asks the artful child, “the way you flew when you were a
5925 little girl?”
5926 
5927 “The way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever
5928 did really fly.”
5929 
5930 “Yes, you did.”
5931 
5932 “The dear old days when I could fly!”
5933 
5934 “Why can’t you fly now, mother?”
5935 
5936 “Because I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget the
5937 way.”
5938 
5939 “Why do they forget the way?”
5940 
5941 “Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It is only
5942 the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly.”
5943 
5944 “What is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay and
5945 innocent and heartless.”
5946 
5947 Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.
5948 
5949 “I do believe,” she says, “that it is this nursery.”
5950 
5951 “I do believe it is,” says Jane. “Go on.”
5952 
5953 They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter
5954 flew in looking for his shadow.
5955 
5956 “The foolish fellow,” says Wendy, “tried to stick it on with soap, and
5957 when he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for
5958 him.”
5959 
5960 “You have missed a bit,” interrupts Jane, who now knows the story better
5961 than her mother. “When you saw him sitting on the floor crying, what did
5962 you say?”
5963 
5964 “I sat up in bed and I said, ‘Boy, why are you crying?’”
5965 
5966 “Yes, that was it,” says Jane, with a big breath.
5967 
5968 “And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the
5969 pirates and the redskins and the mermaids’ lagoon, and the home under
5970 the ground, and the little house.”
5971 
5972 “Yes! which did you like best of all?”
5973 
5974 “I think I liked the home under the ground best of all.”
5975 
5976 “Yes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?”
5977 
5978 “The last thing he ever said to me was, ‘Just always be waiting for me,
5979 and then some night you will hear me crowing.’”
5980 
5981 “Yes.”
5982 
5983 “But, alas, he forgot all about me,” Wendy said it with a smile. She was
5984 as grown up as that.
5985 
5986 “What did his crow sound like?” Jane asked one evening.
5987 
5988 “It was like this,” Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter’s crow.
5989 
5990 “No, it wasn’t,” Jane said gravely, “it was like this;” and she did it
5991 ever so much better than her mother.
5992 
5993 Wendy was a little startled. “My darling, how can you know?”
5994 
5995 “I often hear it when I am sleeping,” Jane said.
5996 
5997 “Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the only
5998 one who heard it awake.”
5999 
6000 “Lucky you,” said Jane.
6001 
6002 And then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the year, and
6003 the story had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her
6004 bed. Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to
6005 see to darn, for there was no other light in the nursery; and while she
6006 sat darning she heard a crow. Then the window blew open as of old, and
6007 Peter dropped in on the floor.
6008 
6009 He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still had
6010 all his first teeth.
6011 
6012 He was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not
6013 daring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.
6014 
6015 “Hullo, Wendy,” he said, not noticing any difference, for he was
6016 thinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress might
6017 have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first.
6018 
6019 “Hullo, Peter,” she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as
6020 possible. Something inside her was crying “Woman, Woman, let go of me.”
6021 
6022 “Hullo, where is John?” he asked, suddenly missing the third bed.
6023 
6024 “John is not here now,” she gasped.
6025 
6026 “Is Michael asleep?” he asked, with a careless glance at Jane.
6027 
6028 “Yes,” she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as
6029 well as to Peter.
6030 
6031 “That is not Michael,” she said quickly, lest a judgment should fall on
6032 her.
6033 
6034 Peter looked. “Hullo, is it a new one?”
6035 
6036 “Yes.”
6037 
6038 “Boy or girl?”
6039 
6040 “Girl.”
6041 
6042 Now surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.
6043 
6044 “Peter,” she said, faltering, “are you expecting me to fly away with
6045 you?”
6046 
6047 “Of course; that is why I have come.” He added a little sternly, “Have
6048 you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?”
6049 
6050 She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning
6051 times pass.
6052 
6053 “I can’t come,” she said apologetically, “I have forgotten how to fly.”
6054 
6055 “I’ll soon teach you again.”
6056 
6057 “O Peter, don’t waste the fairy dust on me.”
6058 
6059 She had risen; and now at last a fear assailed him. “What is it?” he
6060 cried, shrinking.
6061 
6062 “I will turn up the light,” she said, “and then you can see for
6063 yourself.”
6064 
6065 For almost the only time in his life that I know of, Peter was afraid.
6066 “Don’t turn up the light,” he cried.
6067 
6068 She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. She was not a
6069 little girl heart-broken about him; she was a grown woman smiling at it
6070 all, but they were wet-eyed smiles.
6071 
6072 Then she turned up the light, and Peter saw. He gave a cry of pain; and
6073 when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew
6074 back sharply.
6075 
6076 “What is it?” he cried again.
6077 
6078 She had to tell him.
6079 
6080 “I am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty. I grew up long
6081 ago.”
6082 
6083 “You promised not to!”
6084 
6085 “I couldn’t help it. I am a married woman, Peter.”
6086 
6087 “No, you’re not.”
6088 
6089 “Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby.”
6090 
6091 “No, she’s not.”
6092 
6093 But he supposed she was; and he took a step towards the sleeping child
6094 with his dagger upraised. Of course he did not strike. He sat down on
6095 the floor instead and sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him,
6096 though she could have done it so easily once. She was only a woman now,
6097 and she ran out of the room to try to think.
6098 
6099 Peter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She sat up in bed,
6100 and was interested at once.
6101 
6102 “Boy,” she said, “why are you crying?”
6103 
6104 Peter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed.
6105 
6106 “Hullo,” he said.
6107 
6108 “Hullo,” said Jane.
6109 
6110 “My name is Peter Pan,” he told her.
6111 
6112 “Yes, I know.”
6113 
6114 “I came back for my mother,” he explained, “to take her to the
6115 Neverland.”
6116 
6117 “Yes, I know,” Jane said, “I have been waiting for you.”
6118 
6119 When Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post
6120 crowing gloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room
6121 in solemn ecstasy.
6122 
6123 “She is my mother,” Peter explained; and Jane descended and stood by his
6124 side, with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they
6125 gazed at him.
6126 
6127 “He does so need a mother,” Jane said.
6128 
6129 “Yes, I know,” Wendy admitted rather forlornly; “no one knows it so well
6130 as I.”
6131 
6132 “Good-bye,” said Peter to Wendy; and he rose in the air, and the
6133 shameless Jane rose with him; it was already her easiest way of moving
6134 about.
6135 
6136 Wendy rushed to the window.
6137 
6138 “No, no,” she cried.
6139 
6140 “It is just for spring cleaning time,” Jane said, “he wants me always to
6141 do his spring cleaning.”
6142 
6143 “If only I could go with you,” Wendy sighed.
6144 
6145 “You see you can’t fly,” said Jane.
6146 
6147 Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together. Our last glimpse
6148 of her shows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky
6149 until they were as small as stars.
6150 
6151 As you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and her
6152 figure little again, for all this happened long ago. Jane is now a
6153 common grown-up, with a daughter called Margaret; and every spring
6154 cleaning time, except when he forgets, Peter comes for Margaret and
6155 takes her to the Neverland, where she tells him stories about himself,
6156 to which he listens eagerly. When Margaret grows up she will have a
6157 daughter, who is to be Peter’s mother in turn; and thus it will go on,
6158 so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.

6372 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
6373 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

6379 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
6380 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
6381 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
6382 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
6383 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

6412 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
6413 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
6414 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
6415 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

6417 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
6418 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
6419 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance

6421 promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
6422 harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,

6424 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
6425 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
6426 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

6429 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
6430 
6431 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
6432 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
6433 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
6434 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
6435 people in all walks of life.
6436 
6437 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
6438 assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s
6439 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
6440 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
6441 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
6442 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

6473 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
6474 Literary Archive Foundation
6475 
6476 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
6477 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
6478 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
6479 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
6480 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
6481 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
6482 status with the IRS.
6483 
6484 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
6485 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
6486 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
6487 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
6488 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
6489 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
6490 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
6491 particular state visit http://pglaf.org
6492 
6493 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
6494 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
6495 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
6496 approach us with offers to donate.
6497 
6498 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
6499 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
6500 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
6501 
6502 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
6503 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
6504 ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

6508 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
6509 works.
6510 
6511 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
6512 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
6513 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
6514 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
6515 
6516 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
6517 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
6518 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
6519 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
6520 
6521 Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook’s
6522 eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
6523 compressed (zipped), HTML and others.
6524 
6525 Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
6526 the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
6527 VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
6528 new filenames and etext numbers.
6529 
6530 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
6531 
6532 http://www.gutenberg.org
6533 
6534 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
6535 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
6536 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
6537 subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
6538 
6539 EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
6540 are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
6541 download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
6542 search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
6543 download by the etext year.
6544 
6545 http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06
6546 
6547     (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
6548      98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)
6549 
6550 EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
6551 filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
6552 of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
6553 identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
6554 digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
6555 example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:
6556 
6557 http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234
6558 
6559 or filename 24689 would be found at:
6560 http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
