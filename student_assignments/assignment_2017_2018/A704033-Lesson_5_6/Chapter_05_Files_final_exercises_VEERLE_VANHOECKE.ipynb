Sort the words in the dictionary by increasing frequency and write it to a text file called `frequencies.txt`. Make sure your program ignores capitalization. Find out how you can sort a dictionary by value -- there are several ways of doing this, search the web in order to get some help. As a bonus exercise, add code so that the frequency dictionary ignores punctuation (hint: check out `string.punctuation` to get all punctuation)."
