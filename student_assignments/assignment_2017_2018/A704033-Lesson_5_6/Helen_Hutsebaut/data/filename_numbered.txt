111  THE CARDINAL POINTS
112  
113  
114  "It strikes me," said Jerrold Taberman, "that we are booked for
115  everlasting fame, win or lose. We'll either sail down the ages as a
116  brace of heroes, or as the most egregious pair of donkeys that ever
117  botched a job."
118  
119  "Well, Jerry," returned his companion, smiling, "you've as much to do
120  with making the thing a success as I have. I hope you realize the
121  responsibility."
122  
123  The young men chuckled in concert at the thought of all that was
124  involved in this remark, although they looked, not at each other, but
125  out over the sea.
126  
127  It was early twilight in the last week of the month of May. The two
128  speakers were standing on a little jetty that ran out into a small and
129  all but landlocked harbor of an island in East Penobscot Bay. Both were
130  evidently in the earlier twenties, both were dressed in such canvas
131  working-suits as are worn by the sailors in our navy, and both were, at
132  half a glance, gentlemen.
133  
134  The second speaker, John Castleport, was tall and dark. His face, with
135  its prominent features and keen brown eyes, was rather striking than
136  handsome. He stood looking southward to where, in the fading light, the
137  Atlantic shouldered away to the west as if with a hidden purpose of its
138  own. In his hand he held a pair of powerful binoculars, and despite his
139  smile he had the air of being pretty seriously in earnest.
140  
141  Taberman contrasted curiously with his host. He was short and thickset,
142  with blue eyes and fair hair which showed a tendency to curl. As he
143  stood with shoulders turned to the wind, the square collar of his canvas
144  jumper was blown against his round pate, and made a background for his
145  tanned face. He held a briar drop-pipe between his teeth, and his hands
146  were thrust deep into his trousers pockets. Working his pipe into the
147  corner of his mouth, he spoke again.
148  
149  "Hope this breeze won't trouble the old gentleman," he remarked, casting
150  a glance at the billowing double-headers that were driving by aloft.
151  
152  The wind shrilled by the watchers on the jetty, clear, strong, and
153  salt.
154  
155  "Guess not," replied Castleport; "anything short of a hurricane's a
156  sailing-wind for him. He's a mettlesome old chap."
157  
158  "That's right enough. Can't have him spoiling our game by being late,
159  you know. Let's go up; it's getting beastly chilly."
160  
161  They turned and walked along the pier. At the point where it met the
162  shore stood a small boathouse. Thence the ground, covered with a stunted
163  growth of spruce and fir, and the inevitable New England boulders, rose
164  abruptly. Directly in the line of the jetty the shingled roof of a small
165  house showed above the trees. To the westward, in the dimming afterglow
166  of the sunset, the Camden Hills stood out luminous, purple, yet rimmed
167  with a thread of golden fire. Away to the east, clad in soberer colors,
168  rose Mt. Desert, a mass of shadowy greens and blues. The steepness of
169  the path they were ascending soon cut off from the view of the young men
170  these beauties and grandeurs, which, however, they were probably not in
171  a mood to dwell upon; and a minute's walking brought them to the door of
172  the house, a small affair with high-pitched roof and broad veranda. Its
173  shingles were almost the color of the dark evergreens that encircled
174  the clearing in which it stood; its windows reflected with a vacant and
175  glassy stare the fast-fading light. Castleport opened the door for his
176  guest, and followed him into the living-room.
177  
178  The darkness seemed the greater from its contrast with what light yet
179  remained outside, and not until Taberman had put a match to the pile of
180  old shingles and light driftwood in the wide fireplace could they see
181  fairly. The crimson glow showed a room some twenty feet square, with
182  windows on two sides,--the south and east. The joists and sheathing were
183  of planed spruce, left unpainted. The big Mexican fireplace of brick
184  occupied the northwestern corner; in the middle of the room stood
185  conspicuously a round deal table, covered with a litter of pipes,
186  tobacco, magazines, and nautical hardware; between the two eastern
187  windows, below a box-like cabinet which was attached to the wall, was a
188  smaller table with a square top, piled with books and charts. Beneath
189  the southern windows was placed a heavy desk with a faded baize top, the
190  cloth ink-stained and full of holes due to moths and carelessly handled
191  cigars. Of the happy-go-lucky assortment of chairs which completed the
192  furniture of the room, no large portion was in an entirely unbroken
193  condition, but all evidently were meant for service and ease. The walls
194  of the room were decorated with devices in scallop-shells and a few
195  unframed water-colors of the impressionist type. A large chart of
196  Penobscot Bay was tacked to the inside of the door, and a venerable
197  flintlock musket hung below a battered quadrant over the chimneypiece.
198  Everything was simple almost to rudeness, yet the place gave at once and
199  most strongly the impression of comfort and good-fellowship.
200  
201  Castleport laid his binoculars on the desk, and, stepping to a door on
202  his right, opened it and called out:--
203  
204  "Oh, Gonzague?"
205  
206  "Sair?" promptly replied some one from beyond the short passage into
207  which he looked.
208  
209  "Dinner when you're ready, Gonzague."
210  
211  "A' right, sair."
212  
213  Taberman had seated himself by the fire, and here Castleport joined him.
214  Each filled and lighted a pipe, and together they stared at the flames
215  roaring up the wide chimney. The smaller sticks already began to fall
216  apart, pitching outward or dropping between the dogs, and for some
217  moments the young men watched them in silence. At length, as Taberman
218  flung a fresh stick into the flames, Castleport spoke, half to himself.
219  
220  "What a lesson it'll be to the old chap! My aunt! He'll grind his teeth
221  to powder!"
222  
223  "Tooth-powder, eh?" queried the other with a grin. "But we must be sure
224  we have the laugh on the right side. It isn't merely the getting away
225  with the Merle that's the joke; it's the hanging on to her and bringing
226  her back safe."
227  
228  "That's true enough," assented Castleport; "but with pluck and luck and
229  an eye to the three L's, we ought to manage."
230  
231  "You'd better go over the whole plan for me, Jack; you haven't given me
232  half the details, and I'd like to know the latest version. It's
233  certainly important to have everything perfectly understood beforehand."
234  
235  "All right; I'll go over the whole business after dinner, old man. We
236  will act the conspirators rehearsing their villainy; but let's wait for
237  food. I hate discussions on an empty stomach."
238  
239  "Correct; here's Gonzague now."
240  
241  A tall, gray-haired man, with a much-bronzed face, came in and began to
242  clear away the litter on the round table. He had a rugged,
243  weather-beaten countenance, with prominent features and luminous black
244  eyes. Beneath his big, hooked nose a large white mustache, stiff and
245  curled like that of a walrus, half hid a firm, full-lipped mouth. A
246  native of Provence,--soldier, sailor, cook, and deck-hand,--old Gonzague
247  Mairecalde had led sixty-odd years of exciting and polyglot existence,
248  the last three of which had been spent in Castleport's service. Dressed
249  in blue flannel trousers and an immaculate white jacket, the old man
250  moved noiselessly about, swiftly disposing of the things on the table.
251  He seemed to have a place for everything, and the lightest tread and
252  deftest hands imaginable. Having cleared away, he went out, and soon
253  reappeared with linen and service. In a short time the table was ready
254  for the bringing in of the food.
255  
256  "A' ready, sair?" asked Gonzague, tugging at his mustache with his bony
257  fingers.
258  
259  "Two minutes," answered Jack. "Come on, Jerry; let's scrub up."
260  
261  In ten minutes they were seated before a dinner plain but hearty, well
262  cooked and appetizingly served. They were apparently not at all troubled
263  by any incongruity between their rough and not over-fresh sailor clothes
264  and the snowy napery and the silver on which the fire threw dancing and
265  wavering lights. On the walls opposite the fireplace mute, shadowy
266  grotesques helped each other to huge supplies from dishes of vague
267  outline and uncertain size, plied dark forks and spoons with ogre-like
268  gusto, or with heads thrown back and crooked elbows drank like trolls
269  from enormous tankards.
270  
271  After dinner the table was cleared, a jug of ale was placed upon it,
272  with a plate of ship-biscuit and a supply of tobacco. It was the theory
273  of Castleport that the climate of the Island was English enough to
274  warrant this nightly attack upon the October, of which his uncle, who
275  owned the Island, kept always a butt in the cellar. In truth, the fresh
276  coolness of the air at night, the pleasant blaze of the fire, the
277  agreeable scent of burning tobacco, made a tankard or two of ale seem
278  hardly to need an excuse of any sort.
279  
280  With the table pulled forward so that its edge came between them, their
281  pipes lit, their feet stretched out comfortably toward the hearth, the
282  pair of friends smoked for a time in silence, until at last Jack, after
283  refilling and relighting his pipe with great deliberation, broke into
284  speech.
285  
286  "Before I go into the details of this job," he observed, "there's one
287  thing I have to say. It's a waste of breath for me to talk until I know
288  you're with me. I haven't done anything more than to ask you off-hand,
289  old man; now I'd like you to say seriously whether you'll come on this
290  cruise with me or not. I hate to be so horribly businesslike, Jerry,
291  especially in the matter of a lark; but in--er--larking on this scale,
292  things have got to be put on a definite basis,--be perfectly understood,
293  as you said before dinner."
294  
295  Taberman gave his companion a sidelong glance, and began to smile. The
296  smile grew into an audible chuckle; and this in its turn developed into
297  a laugh increasing to a jovial roar.
298  
299  "You solemn old pirate," he cried, "what sort of a quitter do you take
300  me for? I'll give you any kind of a promise you like, provided--_semper
301  more equitis_, you know--Can't bind myself to cut throats, scuttle
302  ships, fly the jolly roger, et cetera. What's your form of oath, eh? Do
303  we drink each other's blood out of a skull, or what?"
304  
305  There was a boyish exuberance about Jerrold Taberman, a debonair
306  abandon, which he never could outgrow. It accorded well with his
307  youthful face and careless mien, which made him so marked a contrast to
308  his friend. Castleport, although impulsive and disposed to jollity as
309  only a hale and hearty young man of twenty-two can be, was, on the
310  whole, of a temperament the reverse of boisterous. He responded frankly
311  to Jerry's outburst.
312  
313  "Well, old man," said he, "there's nothing more needed than your word
314  that you'll go, and stick it out to the end. I knew you would, Jerry.
315  Confound it, give us your flipper!"
316  
317  In his enthusiasm he caught Taberman's hand and wrung it heartily, being
318  evidently moved more by some inner consciousness of the weighty nature
319  of the scheme he was about to outline than by anything that had actually
320  been said between them. Jerry laughed, and returned the grip with
321  interest.
322  
323  "And now," continued Castleport, "I'll let you have particulars galore.
324  I'll tell you the beginning of it first: how the idea came to me. About
325  three weeks ago I decided I'd go abroad,--I wrote you, you remember.
326  Well, I went to Uncle Randolph, and asked him for a letter of credit.
327  That's what comes of the pleasant arrangement by which all my property's
328  in trust till I'm twenty-five! Beastly nuisance!"
329  
330  "Of course it is," assented his companion. "It's queer your father made
331  such a will. However," he added, as if with the feeling that he was
332  perhaps touching upon delicate ground, "that's neither here nor there.
333  Heave ahead."
334  
335  "You know why I wanted to go," Jack went on, "and so"--
336  
337  "Slow up a bit," interrupted the other, mischief shining in his eyes;
338  "why should you want to go particularly?"
339  
340  "Confound you!" retorted Castleport. "You know perfectly well! Do you
341  think it's any fun to be here when--when"--
342  
343  "When Miss Marchfield's on the other side," finished Jerry, with the air
344  of enjoying a huge joke.
345  
346  Jack shifted uncomfortably in his seat, leaned forward to rap the ashes
347  out of his pipe on the firedog, and then looked at his friend seriously.
348  
349  "I won't be roughed, Jerry," he said. "You know perfectly well I'm dead
350  in earnest about her, and I'll thank you to let up."
351  
352  "All right, Jack; I beg your pardon; but I would like to ask one thing.
353  It's not exactly my business, of course, but really it's something I'd
354  like to know in connection with this scheme."
355  
356  "Fire away," Castleport said rather grimly.
357  
358  "Well, then, what I want to know is why the President's so set against
359  your marrying Katrine Marchfield?"
360  
361  "It isn't time to talk of marrying," Jack returned somewhat stiffly.
362  "She may have something to say to that."
363  
364  "Of course, old fellow; but you know what I mean. What's his objection
365  to your trying?"
366  
367  "I don't see how that affects the cruise, exactly, but I don't mind
368  telling you; only of course I shouldn't want it talked about. It's so
369  unreasonable, and honestly I should hate to seem to be giving Uncle
370  Randolph any sort of a black eye."
371  
372  "I shouldn't repeat it, Jack; but you needn't say anything if you'd
373  rather not."
374  
375  "It's only that it looks as if Uncle Randolph was infernally obstinate
376  and cranky, and he really isn't. He hadn't any reason to give me, that
377  amounted to anything. He talked about Katrine's not having any money;
378  but of course that's all poppy-cock. I've got a good bit myself when I
379  come into it, and he's always told me I should have all his. Of course
380  Katrine hasn't much, though she'll have something, I suppose, from her
381  aunt."
382  
383  "Aunt?"
384  
385  "Why, Mrs. Fairhew. Katrine's traveling with her now. She's the only
386  near relative Katrine has."
387  
388  "But if it isn't money"--
389  
390  "No, it isn't that. The truth is--I heard it from Mrs. Fairhew once; I
391  wasn't sure then, and I'm not now, whether she knew quite how much she
392  was telling me, and meant it for a warning, or not. I'm half inclined to
393  think she did."
394  
395  "But what was it?" inquired Jerry, as Jack paused to meditate, with his
396  eyes fixed earnestly on the fire.
397  
398  "Oh, Uncle Randolph had some sort of a row with Katrine's father when
399  they were young men. I fancy it was about a girl, for I know there was
400  one somewhere along about that time. I've heard father speak of it, and
401  say it altered Uncle Randolph's whole life. Anyway, there was some sort
402  of a scrap, and Uncle Randolph never forgave it."
403  
404  "Humph!" was Taberman's comment. "It's rather crotchety of him to vent
405  his spite on Miss Marchfield."
406  
407  "Of course it is," Castleport answered, "but he's not so bad as it
408  looks. He's been awfully good to me all my life."
409  
410  A brief pause followed, in which both were probably reflecting upon the
411  character of Randolph Drake, one of Boston's prominent men, president of
412  one of the largest banks, and trustee of a dozen important corporations;
413  a man whose chief aim in life was, apparently, making money, whose
414  amusement was yachting. It was in connection with this sport that he had
415  a few years before bought the island and put up the house in which his
416  motives were now being discussed. The place served as a shooting-box or
417  as a base of supplies, and was provided with a trig little harbor
418  exactly adapted for the accommodation of the President's yacht, the
419  Merle.
420  
421  "After all," Jack said at length, "Uncle Randolph really cares more for
422  me than he does for anything else in the world."
423  
424  "And so when he suspected that you were going abroad to try to marry the
425  daughter of his old enemy, he wouldn't supply the funds."
426  
427  "He can't seem to get it into his head that I am grown up, anyhow,"
428  grumbled Jack. "I've made up my mind now that I'll convince him that I
429  am."
430  
431  "Why in the world didn't you borrow the money, Jack? That would have
432  been easy enough."
433  
434  "Well, when I came of age I made Uncle Randolph a sort of a promise that
435  I wouldn't borrow. He put it that it would be evading the intent of my
436  father's will; and of course it would. Anyway, Uncle Randolph himself
437  put a bigger idea into my head. It took me one day and two nights,
438  mostly without sleep, to think it out, and then I got hold of you."
439  
440  "How did he suggest it?"
441  
442  "He was really sorry for me; I could see that. Only he had the air of
443  feeling I was so young that any other cake would do as well as the one
444  I wanted. The very day that he refused to let me go abroad, he suggested
445  that I come down here with Gonzague and some friend or other. He thought
446  that if I fooled round the bay until he came to pick me up on the Merle,
447  I should get over my wish to go abroad. He said I was run down, needed
448  change, and so on. He's coming June 5, and plans to go on down to the
449  Provinces. Then he said that after he had had his cruise on the Merle I
450  might perhaps like to have her a week or two myself. It was a mighty
451  great concession, let me tell you. When I think of taking the boat, I'm
452  half ashamed of myself, the old gentleman's so rum fond of her."
453  
454  "And that put the notion into your head?"
455  
456  "Yes, only not at the moment. I said to myself that if I was going to
457  cruise in the Merle I'd like to go across in her; but it wasn't till
458  that night, just as I was turning in, that the idea of getting her now
459  and running off came to me. It fairly bowled me over!"
460  
461  "I should think it might!" laughed Taberman.
462  
463  "At first it seemed the easiest thing in the world. Then I began to
464  think of objections, and as fast as I got one out of the way another
465  popped up. I've worked at it like a prize puzzle. I've got my crew
466  picked out, I've planned how to get possession of the yacht and to get
467  rid of her old crew; and then--Hurrah for the Mediterranean!"
468  
469  "Oh, Jacko, you devil!" cried Taberman. "I wouldn't have believed you
470  had it in you! Do you really think we can do it?"
471  
472  "Do it! Of course we'll do it. Didn't I tell you I'd got my crew
473  already? Ten strappers, not counting Gonzague."
474  
475  "Did Gonzague kick?"
476  
477  "Gonzague? Did you ever consider, Tab, those eyes of his, with that nose
478  and mouth?"
479  
480  "No," Jerry responded, "I've never given his features any especial
481  critical overhauling."
482  
483  "_Saracen!_" Jack said, lowering his voice. "When you see that
484  combination in a Spaniard or a Provençalese, it spells Moorish marauder
485  every time. He doesn't know it, I fancy; but there's good old ripe
486  Moorish pirate blood in him, and it came sizzling to the top the moment
487  I broached the scheme. Besides, Gonzague would have his throat cut for
488  me any time."
489  
490  "That's so, but he's as honest an old soul as there is above ground."
491  
492  "Of course I told him, and I told the crew, that it was a lark. You
493  know I've knocked about Penobscot Bay ever since I got out of the
494  nursery. Everybody knows me, and at Isle au Haut I've been so much that
495  I'm almost like one of their own pals to the natives. I got hold of my
496  men pretty easily. Of course they look on me as the same as the
497  President's son; and they were willing enough to leave the fishing for
498  better wages than they could earn anywhere else. They all like me, and
499  so of course they all take advantage of me in the way of wages."
500  
501  "I confess I don't see where your economy comes in, Jacky," observed
502  Taberman, giving a poke to the wasting fire. "I don't know much about
503  expenses, but I should think it would cost as much to hire a crew as to
504  go without one."
505  
506  Castleport grew grave and moved a little impatiently.
507  
508  "There's a question for a casuist," he said. "I'm taking these men off
509  on the trust that Uncle Randolph will let me pay them when I get home.
510  It's a deuced sight more like borrowing than I wish it were, though of
511  course my allowance comes in; but I'm bound that he shall get it into
512  his head that I'm no longer in leading-strings, and"--
513  
514  Taberman looked at him affectionately and comprehendingly.
515  
516  "That'll be all right, old man," he said consolingly. "We'll get out of
517  that somehow. I'd like to see the President's face when he finds he's
518  left high and dry down here and the Merle has flitted across the
519  Atlantic without him."
520  
521  "Oh, he won't be here. We'll capture the yacht at North Haven. I'll show
522  you the whole scheme to-morrow on the chart. I've brought down more than
523  a thousand for this coast and the Mediterranean! Now let's get to bed.
524  It's only a week or so that we have left to sleep with a clear
525  conscience."
526  
527  Taberman rose from his seat, then without warning suddenly slapped his
528  knees with his hands and burst into a roar of laughter.
529  
530  "Oh, by George," he cried, "what a jolt it'll be for Uncle Randolph!"
531  
532  "That's the cream of the whole thing," responded Jack, joining in the
533  laugh. "He'll be so surprised to find out that I'm grown up."

540  Chapter Two
541  
542  THE FOG COMES IN
543  
544  
545  The Casino at North Haven is a curious little box, known
546  locally--possibly from its situation at the end of a fairly long
547  wharf--as the "Fo'c'sle." It has but one room, paneled with imitation
548  Japanese carvings, and having an attractive divan-like seat in a wide
549  bay-window, where one may lounge and watch the vessels passing through
550  the Thoroughfare. Outwardly the building is very plain, its two
551  prominent features being the bay-window, which looks south, and a flight
552  of outside stairs on the west which lead to a little nest of a balcony
553  half hidden under the gable-end of the roof above this window.
554  
555  The balcony is so covered by the peak of the roof that its interior is
556  not visible from the wharf, and a person sitting on the settle at the
557  back of it can be seen only from a boat some distance out on the water.
558  
559  The Casino is little used, and although the caretaker unlocks the door
560  each morning, the place is more generally deserted than not. The
561  subscribers who come down to the wharf to start for rowing or sailing
562  sometimes step in, wait for friends, or use the place as a storage for
563  extra wraps; sometimes a riotous group of children holds brief but noisy
564  possession; but after sunset the solitude is generally unbroken until
565  ten o'clock, when the caretaker comes to lock up for the night. If the
566  weather be bad, it is not unusual for the Casino to remain unvisited for
567  the entire day. It affords a convenient shelter when it is needed,
568  however, and its wharf, with a float on either side, makes a good
569  landing-place; and it is, in a word, one of the numerous class of things
570  which in this world are not constantly in demand, but which, when they
571  are wanted at all, are wanted badly.
572  
573  Here, on the evening of the fourth of June, Jerrold Taberman, wrapped in
574  a shapeless ulster,--for a thick fog was driving in from the
575  southeast,--sat awaiting his friend. Half an hour earlier Jack had gone
576  to get something to eat, and Jerry had agreed to meet him here. Taberman
577  was somewhat tired to-night, and beginning to feel the strain of three
578  crowded and exciting days in which he had had little time for anything
579  but action and sleep. The young men had completed their arrangements at
580  the Island, had left Gonzague in charge there, had notified the future
581  crew to report to the Provençalese on the evening of the third, and to
582  hold themselves in readiness to sail immediately on the arrival of the
583  Merle. The pair had then taken the big market-boat, a whitehall used for
584  bringing supplies from Isle au Haut, and with a couple of the most able
585  of the Isle au Haut men, selected beforehand, had sailed over to an
586  unfrequented cove in Vinal Haven, on the south side of the Thoroughfare.
587  There they encamped in hiding. They had reached their place of
588  concealment by night, and next afternoon had the satisfaction of seeing
589  the Merle come in from the westward and drop anchor just inside the
590  channel, off the "Fo'c'sle."
591  
592  "By Jove, isn't she a fine sight!" Castleport exclaimed
593  enthusiastically; and Jerry assented no less warmly.
594  
595  The Merle ran in under full sail, with a quartering breeze. Her clean
596  white hull, eighty-four feet on the water-line, her shining brasses, her
597  broad spread of snowy canvas, the easy run of her long counter, combined
598  to make a picture which, even personal interest aside, could not fail to
599  stir such enthusiasts as Jack and Tab.
600  
601  On the evening of the arrival of the Merle two gentlemen and three
602  ladies had gone on board, evidently to dine, as they did not leave until
603  nearly ten o'clock. Castleport and Taberman, lying concealed among the
604  bushes overgrowing a tiny promontory on Vinal Haven, had watched all
605  this through their night-glasses. Jack, whose eyes were as keen as a
606  hawk's, had even thought that he could distinguish who the visitors
607  were. With guests on board there was evidently nothing that the
608  conspirators could do but to watch, and when this was over they smoked a
609  good-night pipe together over their campfire, and for the hundredth time
610  fell to considering their chances of success. Behind them in the shadow
611  lay the two sailors, wrapped in their blankets and sleeping the sleep
612  which only the genuine mariner knows; Jack glanced at them as if he felt
613  that somehow he was personally responsible for carrying through the
614  enterprise for which they had been enlisted.
615  
616  "What the deuce shall we do if the President takes it into his head to
617  get under weigh for the island to-morrow?" Jerry demanded in a subdued
618  voice.
619  
620  "Oh, that's all right," Jack answered in the same key. "He won't. He's
621  fond of North Haven; it's an old stamping-ground of his, and he'll never
622  go on without having had at least one night's bridge here. That's part
623  of the cruise. Besides, it's going to be thick, or I'm a duffer."
624  
625  Thick it certainly was next day. The brisk southeasterly breeze that
626  blew through the Thoroughfare all day seemed to roll in white billows of
627  fog far more rapidly than it could take them out at the other end. The
628  strait acted as a sort of condenser, in which the mist became almost
629  tangibly more solid, until at nightfall it was, as one of Castleport's
630  men put it, "blacker 'n a tar-bucket." Under cover of the obscurity Jack
631  had had the market-boat reloaded with such necessities as they had
632  brought over for their camp, and rowed silently over to one of the
633  Casino floats. Here he and Taberman got out, and then the men, by his
634  orders, worked the boat into concealment between the spiles of the
635  wharf, there to await further orders, utterly invisible in the fog.
636  
637  The two arch-conspirators mounted the wharf, and for some time kept
638  watch to see if any one came ashore from the Merle; but as the time wore
639  on to half-past seven they concluded that the President must be dining
640  on board. Assured of this, Jack left Jerry to keep watch, and went up to
641  the village bakery for food, dinner for himself and his friend having
642  been forgotten in the midst of more important things. Tab, left alone
643  in the wet darkness, had mounted to the balcony, and there sat in gloomy
644  state, wondering if Jack were never coming back. He had no light by
645  which to see his watch, but since he had heard seven bells from the
646  Merle he felt sure that eight o'clock must be close at hand, when his
647  attention was caught by the sound through the fog of the quick
648  _thud-thud_, _thud-thud_ of oars against thole-pins. In an instant he
649  was thoroughly alert, his senses primitively acute, and his growing
650  sensation of vague depression utterly dispelled. He heard some one pull
651  hastily to the "Fo'c'sle;" the muffled chugging of the oar-blades as the
652  rower held water; the gentle slapping of the boat's wash against the
653  float; and then the clatter of the oars on the thwarts. Then by the dim
654  light of the lantern at the end of the pier he saw a man spring on to
655  the east float and secure his boat; give a quick, nervous tug at the
656  painter to be sure that it was fast, and disappear from the field of
657  vision which was bounded by the edge of the sloping roof. He fancied he
658  heard a murmur as if the newcomer spoke a word of encouragement to the
659  sailors in damp concealment under the wharf, and then had hardly time to
660  wonder where Jack had been in a boat, before Castleport had run lightly
661  up the plank from the float to the pier, and thence up the steps to
662  Tab's place of concealment.
663  
664  "Sit tight!" whispered Castleport breathlessly.
665  
666  "What's--" began Jerry.
667  
668  "Sh! We've the chance of a lifetime! I--I"--He gasped for breath, but
669  caught it with a great gulp, and hurried on. "I've been aboard, Tab!
670  Come in, man! Get back, get back!" He forced his friend into a seat in
671  the farthest corner of the little balcony, caught his breath again, and
672  began to chuckle. The sound of oars was again audible,--this time the
673  steady, measured stroke of a heavy boat well pulled.
674  
675  "Here's Uncle Randolph," cried Jack with a sort of whispered shout.
676  "Here's Uncle Randolph!" And seizing his friend by the shoulders, he
677  shook him and banged his head noiselessly against the wall for sheer
678  glee.
679  
680  "Stop, Jacko, stop it! Hold up, or by Jumbo I'll yell! Look there! Here
681  they are."
682  
683  As the pair hurried cautiously to look out over the edge of the balcony,
684  a large cutter, pulled by six men, came out of the fog into the dim
685  illumination of the pier-light. Three gentlemen in light overcoats were
686  visible in the stern-sheets, the one in the middle steering. A little
687  removed from the President and the two men who were evidently his
688  guests, sat one of the officers of the Merle.
689  
690  "Way enough," called the steersman in a sharp voice.
691  
692  "Oh, my aunt!" whispered Tab, giving Jack a nudge. "The President has
693  very little idea that he's made all the way in the Merle he's likely to
694  for one while."
695  
696  The cutter ran smoothly along beside the float.
697  
698  "In bows! Fend off, there!"
699  
700  At the word the oars were unshipped, and a couple of sailors caught the
701  rope which edged the staging. The cutter came to a stop. A seaman leaped
702  out and held the boat, the officer sprang to the float and presented an
703  arm for the President and his guests as they stepped to land.
704  
705  "We'll be down at eleven," the President said to the officer. "If you
706  want an hour or two ashore, there's some sort of a shindy going on
707  opposite the post office, I believe--dance or something. Mind you're
708  sharp on time for me, though."
709  
710  "All right, sir. Eleven o'clock it is, sir," returned the officer,
711  touching his cap deferentially as the three gentlemen turned away.
712  
713  "Great Scott!" cried Jack into Tab's ear in an excited whisper. "Do you
714  suppose the President's going to get rid of all those men for me
715  himself? Was ever such luck!"
716  
717  The boat still lay at the landing. The men began to discuss going
718  ashore, and every word was easily audible to the two watchers in the
719  balcony.
720  
721  "I vote we go," quoth he with the boat-hook. "It ain't every day the old
722  hunks gives us a chance to stretch a leg ashore."
723  
724  "It'll be dry, Tom," spoke up one in the boat. "Ye won't get so much as
725  a swig o' cider-water this side o' Bar Harbor."
726  
727  "Well, boys, let's try it, anyhow," advised the officer. "If it's dry
728  there, it's wet enough here."
729  
730  "That's right," responded another. "Damn yer slops, Bill, ye dude; the'
731  're's good as mine, an' any togs is good enough for po'r Jack. Let's go
732  ashore an' take a look at these Thoryfare bewties."
733  
734  This seemed to settle it. The boat was made fast, and the men straggled
735  up the pier, talking and laughing as they went.
736  
737  Tab and Jack fairly hugged each other in delight at this development,
738  and then Jerry opened fire.
739  
740  "You said you'd been aboard," he began, "what"--
741  
742  "When I left the bakery," Jack answered, without waiting for the
743  question to be finished, "I said to myself that the fog was so thick it
744  would be perfectly safe to take a boat and row out, on the chances that
745  I might find out something. I meant to get astern of the Merle and give
746  the wind a chance to bring me some of the talk aboard. I borrowed a
747  little pea-pod from the pier behind Staples', and out I went. When I got
748  to the yacht, I found I could lay alongside, for there wasn't a soul on
749  deck. I hauled off my jacket and hung it over the boat's side for a
750  fender, so she wouldn't make any noise, and took the painter in my fist.
751  Then I stood on the thwart and jumped for the rail on the port side."
752  
753  "You'd have made the devil of a mess if you'd missed it," commented
754  Jerry.
755  
756  "But I didn't. I got hold, but, Gad, I came near going overboard!"
757  
758  He stopped to laugh, this time fearlessly aloud, while Jerry chuckled.
759  
760  "I lay flat along the bulwark," Jack went on, "by the main rigging. The
761  skylight-covers were on, of course, but the frames were half up, and I
762  could get scraps of the talk in the cabin. The men Uncle Randolph's got
763  along with him are old Melford and Tom Bardale. I thought I'd die to
764  hear them go on. Old Melford was grumbling away,--he's always an awful
765  croaker, you know. He piped up once, and said it was just his luck to
766  have to suffer both fog and bridge when he came for solid cruising.
767  Uncle Randolph and Bardale both poo-poohed him, and asked him if he'd
768  rather play slap-Jack. The old boys are going to play bridge
769  somewhere,--I didn't find out where, but it doesn't matter; they're
770  settled, anyway. I didn't hear anything else, for I'd hardly time to
771  drop into the pea-pod and get out of the way of the men from the
772  fo'c'sle that came out to haul in the cutter on the boat-boom. I rushed
773  ashore as tight as I could pelt, and you saw the rest. This dance
774  business, too! Luck's with us!"
775  
776  He stopped, all but breathless. With one accord the pair started for the
777  stairs, and took their way to the pier, where the lantern made a dim and
778  watery illumination in the midst of the fog. Castleport seized Jerry by
779  the arm and led him to the edge of the pier.
780  
781  "With this wind," he said with great earnestness, "we'd best run out to
782  the westward, and beat along the south of Vinal Haven. We'll have more
783  sea-room, and with the weather as thick as this, I don't deny that even
784  that's risky enough."
785  
786  "It is a nasty night," Taberman assented with emphasis. "Are you for
787  going outside Wooden Ball Island?"
788  
789  "Tell that when we've got by Dogfish and the rest of 'em," replied Jack
790  briefly. "I mean to leave that to Dave, anyhow."
791  
792  "You're dead sure you want to do it, old man?" queried Tab with the air
793  of one who would not have asked the question had he not been confident
794  that the answer would be in the affirmative.
795  
796  "I'd do it ten times over just for the lark!" snorted Jack. "Now
797  then--business!"
798  
799  They descended the ladder to the eastern float, and Castleport called
800  out guardedly to the men who had all this time been lying concealed in
801  the market-boat under the wharf. A slight bumping, a muttered oath, the
802  rattle of an oar on the thwart, and then the nose of the boat emerged
803  from beneath the pier. A vigorous thrust with the boat-hook against one
804  of the outer stringers shot her up alongside the float.
805  
806  "All right?" inquired Jack.
807  
808  A stoutly built man of short stature standing in the bow of the boat
809  answered.
810  
811  "Right enough, sir; but a mite holler."
812  
813  "Well, Dave, we'll fix that in a spell," said Jack. "We've got a bit to
814  do first, though. Let's have your watch, Tab."
815  
816  He pulled out his own as he spoke, and took Jerry's with it in one hand.
817  Then with the other hand he struck a match, which he craftily sheltered
818  from the wind.
819  
820  "You're a minute fast of me, Jerry," he commented, throwing away the
821  match and returning the watch. "I say eight seventeen, and you say eight
822  eighteen. You and Jim take the market-boat and go over to the other
823  float. Take the Merle's cutter and tow her out to one of the moorings
824  off the club here. At eight forty-eight sharp,--just half an hour,--you
825  hail the Merle. Sing out like the deuce, and tell 'em to send a boat
826  ashore. I'll see that they send one, and that when they've left there'll
827  be nobody aboard but me. In about fifteen minutes from now a boat'll
828  come ashore, but you needn't mind her. Dave'll look out for that
829  business. Just you pick out some mooring a bit to windward of the direct
830  line between the yacht and the Casino, so they shan't spot you. When you
831  hear a boat coming in answer to your hail, you come out yourselves, and
832  tow the cutter. That you're to make fast astern the Merle. Got it all
833  clear?"
834  
835  "I guess so," Jerry answered. "I don't notice a boat till eight
836  forty-eight; then I hail, and when I hear a boat coming in answer I cut
837  out to the Merle. Give me some matches to see the time with. Well, good
838  luck, old man; be sharp, or you'll dish the whole game."
839  
840  With this parting caution Taberman stepped into the market-boat, while
841  Dave got out. Oars were not needed, but Jerry and the sailor easily
842  pulled the market-boat around by the spiles to the other float, where
843  they lay concealed in the rolling fog.
844  
845  "Now then, Dave," Jack said as they disappeared, "you and I are the ones
846  that are going to open this ball. You take me out, set me aboard just as
847  if you did that sort of thing regularly,--do you see? As if I'd paid you
848  a quarter for setting me aboard, you know. Then you row back. Here's a
849  boat that'll do," he broke off, pointing to a small whitehall boat made
850  fast to the staging. "Get in, and pull me out."
851  
852  The pair stepped into the little craft, and when Dave began rowing Jack
853  continued his instructions.
854  
855  "When you get back to the float," he said, "you just make this boat
856  fast, and hide under the shadow of those stairs on the outside of the
857  Casino--you know?"
858  
859  "Yes, sir."
860  
861  "Wait for a boat from the yacht with three or four men in it.--Pull on
862  your port oar a bit; that's good.--When they get ashore and go up the
863  wharf, you take their tender and rush her out to a mooring same as Mr.
864  Taberman's done. Do you see?"
865  
866  "Guess so, sir," was Dave's response. "Do you want me to catch the same
867  one?"
868  
869  "Any one'll do, provided it won't be seen by a boat pulling ashore from
870  the Merle. You won't have to go far to hide in this fog.--Little
871  stronger on your port oar again; tide's cutting you down.--When you hear
872  Mr. Taberman hailing, you stand by, and as soon as a boat goes by in
873  answer, you pull out to the yacht and make fast astern. Give her plenty
874  of painter; all she's got. Do you see now?"
875  
876  "I guess I do, sir. You're going to have a boat on every davit that way,
877  ain't you, sir?"
878  
879  "If it works," Jack answered in a low voice, for they were now under the
880  yacht's port quarter.
881  
882  Dave pulled around in silence to the steps on the starboard side.
883  
884  "Here we are, sir," he said in an even tone as he caught at the ladder
885  grating.
886  
887  The Merle, dimly visible by the foggy glow of her riding-light, was
888  pitching slightly in the chop, and the small dinghy bobbed up and down
889  beside her like a cork beside a floating spar. The waves slapped against
890  the yacht's sheer, wetting her top-sides with spray and poppling away
891  merrily under her counter. In the thick dimness her masts loomed up
892  almost supernaturally tall.
893  
894  "Hello aboard the Merle," shouted Castleport.
895  
896  "Hello?" answered a voice from forward, and in a moment a tall, burly
897  figure appeared on deck by the ladder.
898  
899  "What is it?" asked the tall man. "What d' you want?"
900  
901  "Hello, Camper," cried Jack, recognizing the voice as that of his
902  uncle's sailing-master. "Hello, Camper, don't you know me?"
903  
904  He sprang up the steps and gained the deck.
905  
906  "Why, Mr. Castleport," the skipper cried in a hearty tone, "whatever are
907  you doin' here? Thought you was over to the Island. How are you, sir?"
908  
909  "Cold," Jack answered with a laugh. "How's yourself? Fit as usual, I
910  suppose. President aboard?"
911  
912  "No, sir. He's gone ashore to some sort of a gatherin'. I never thought
913  to see you here, sir."
914  
915  "Oh, I came over to join the yacht here. I got tired of waiting. I
916  shan't want you any longer," he called down to the figure in the dinghy
917  below. "Much obliged."
918  
919  The dinghy and Dave melted into the blackness of the night.
920  
921  "Come below, Mr. Castleport, sir. You'll have a bracer?" the genial
922  sailing-master asked. "Nasty night, ain't it?"
923  
924  "It is that," Jack agreed, "but I'm in hopes there'll be a change soon."
925  
926  And smiling at the thought how truly the words expressed his secret
927  intent, he followed the worthy Camper below.

934  Chapter Three
935  
936  IT BLOWS SOUTHEAST
937  
938  
939  The saloon of the Merle was a spacious cabin, paneled in Cuban cedar.
940  Along both sides ran transoms cushioned in dark green corduroy, which
941  contrasted pleasantly with the red of the woodwork. On either side of
942  the companion-way were big closets, the doors of which, framing large
943  mirrors, opened forward against the after ends of the transoms. Both to
944  port and to starboard the cabin was lined with lockers for flags,
945  charts, and bottles, except where the recessed bookcases came in the
946  middle. Large nickeled Argand lamps to port and starboard on the for'ard
947  bulkhead illuminated the interior. Sheathed in cedar, the butt of the
948  schooner's mainmast stood in the fore part of the saloon; and aft from
949  it ran a mahogany table around which were placed some
950  comfortable-looking chairs. All in all, the impression of power and
951  grace which one received from regarding the outside of the Merle was
952  equaled by the feeling of comfort, and, indeed, almost of luxury, one
953  had upon viewing her below decks.
954  
955  It was in this pleasant retreat that Jack had settled himself in less
956  than a minute after his arrival on the yacht. The good skipper, who had
957  kept an almost fatherly eye on the youth ever since he was old enough to
958  "fist a rope," sat uneasily on the edge of the divan on the port side.
959  Jack, sprawled out on the opposite transom, lit a cigarette, and looked
960  up at the skylight.
961  
962  "My aunt! But I'm glad to be aboard again," he declared. "How is
963  everything? What sort of a run down did you have?"
964  
965  "Pretty fair, sir," returned the master. "We went to Marblehead, and
966  then to Portsmouth. Mr. Drake, he spent the time in seeing his friends.
967  Then we run to Portland, and then to Boothbay. We run in here yesterday.
968  Nothin' much to tell of on the cruise."
969  
970  "You've made schedule time," Jack commented. "You are here just when you
971  were due."
972  
973  "Yes, we got here," Camper assented, "though 't one time, when I see the
974  stores that had to come aboard, I doubted if we should get started for a
975  week."
976  
977  "More stores than usual?" queried Jack, with a little spark of interest
978  in his eye.
979  
980  "Well, Mr. Drake, he 'lowed that last year when we got becalmed down
981  the coast some of the provisions fell short, and he vowed he'd never get
982  caught in that shape again; so this time he's stocked up fit to do the
983  Nor'west Passage. He's got every kind of a thing to eat that man ever
984  put into tins, you may bet your life."
985  
986  "Trust him to have an eye to the galley," laughed Jack, reflecting how
987  satisfactory a complement to the plain provisions waiting at the Island
988  would be this extensive assortment of choice eatables. "Well, I'm for
989  sleeping aboard. Can you give me a lift with my luggage?"
990  
991  Everything he had said since he came on board had been preliminary to
992  this. His one chance of getting the sailing-master to a safe distance
993  lay in inducing Camper to go ashore on an errand. To this question the
994  skipper replied, Yankee fashion, with another.
995  
996  "Where is it, sir?"
997  
998  "Go to Mullin's and tell 'em you're from me;--you'd better do it
999  yourself, Camper;--and get them to give you a steamer-trunk and two
1000  bags. Do you know the place? It's the only boarding-house there is in
1001  the village. Anybody can tell you."
1002  
1003  "I know it, sir. 'Bout a cable's length up the road."
1004  
1005  "Yes; that's it. I don't think you'll find the trunk heavy," Jack went
1006  on, with a secret inclination to speak very fast and a consciousness
1007  that he must appear cool and deliberate. "Of course you'll take a couple
1008  of men to tote it, but I don't like to send an ordinary seaman up
1009  there."
1010  
1011  He wondered what he should reply if asked why not; but Camper, who had
1012  long been trained under President Drake to habits of unquestioning
1013  obedience, replied with perfect simplicity:--
1014  
1015  "All right, sir, I'll have it aboard in half an hour. Your old
1016  stateroom's all ready, I believe. You just ring for the steward if you
1017  want anything, sir."
1018  
1019  "Thanks," responded Jack, taking a book from its place as he spoke, as
1020  if with the intention of settling himself to read.
1021  
1022  Camper withdrew, and Jack listened eagerly till he heard footsteps on
1023  the deck, the rattle of the davit-tackle, the splash of the boat
1024  alongside, and then the rhythm of receding oars. The moment he was sure
1025  of not being seen by the skipper he closed his book with a bang, flung
1026  it on the table, looked at his watch, and went hurriedly on deck. In the
1027  lee of the mainmast he paused to light a fresh cigarette, and then began
1028  untying the cover of the mainsail, loosening the points and pulling
1029  them through the grommets. As he worked his way aft, he suddenly
1030  thought he heard the sound of oars. He stopped to make sure: there could
1031  be no doubt of it; some one was pulling toward the Merle. In a flash
1032  Jack saw his scheme ruined in any one of a thousand ways. He set his
1033  teeth and ran over rapidly in his head the possibilities, but without
1034  reaching any satisfactory conclusion. Then he walked aft, and putting
1035  his hands on the rail, bent over the yacht's port quarter and peered
1036  into the fog. With a feeling of relief he realized from the sound and
1037  time of the strokes that the approaching boat was a small one, and was
1038  pulled by one pair of oars only. He had hardly decided this when he
1039  discerned the cause of his alarm, and almost laughed to see nothing more
1040  formidable than a small pea-pod, pulled by a boy. The rower came
1041  alongside and rested on his oars, while Jack watched him curiously.
1042  
1043  "Is that Mr. Drake's vessel?" inquired the boy.
1044  
1045  "Yes," Jack returned. "What's wanted?"
1046  
1047  "The postmaster said 'f I'd bring ye these letters ye'd give me a
1048  quarter," replied the youthful oarsman.
1049  
1050  "Mr. Drake isn't aboard now," said Jack.
1051  
1052  "Well, ye c'n give me my quarter jes' the same," the boy rejoined. "I'll
1053  let ye hev the letters, 'n' he'll make it right with ye later. He lef'
1054  word this evenin' for his mail to be brung him every time it come, an'
1055  't was that foggy the Sylvy got in late from Rocklan', 'n' I couldn't
1056  get roun' to bring it out before. 'Twan't sorted till after Mr. Staples
1057  hed his supper."
1058  
1059  "All right," Jack said hastily. "Come alongside."
1060  
1061  He feared to create suspicion, and felt that the only thing to do at the
1062  moment was to get rid of the boy. He gave the youth a quarter, and took
1063  the letters in exchange, mentally saying to himself that he hoped they
1064  were not of importance. The boy went pulling away as if in most unusual
1065  elation, and Castleport, thrusting the letters into the breast pocket of
1066  his coat, returned to his work. He had not quite finished untying the
1067  points when he heard Jerry's hail from the mooring.
1068  
1069  "Merle, ahoy! Ho-ro aboard the Merle!" came booming through the fog in
1070  Taberman's most stentorian tones.
1071  
1072  Jack placed himself in the companion-way as if just emerging from the
1073  cabin, and waited for another hail.
1074  
1075  "Merle ahoy! Aho-o-o-y aboard the Merle!" again rang through the thick
1076  night above the sound of the wind, the water, and the cordage.
1077  
1078  "Hallo-o-o!" bawled back Castleport.
1079  
1080  "Send ... boat ... ashore!" came the voice.
1081  
1082  Jerry was apparently able to outroar all the bulls of Bashan, and was
1083  doing his worst.
1084  
1085  "Aye--oh!" Jack yelled in reply, and walked quickly forward.
1086  
1087  The steward had heard the rumpus, and was standing in the forecastle
1088  companion. Capless, and wearing his white jacket, he gaped about like a
1089  quizzical seal.
1090  
1091  "Some one hailing from the shore," said Jack shortly; "want a boat.
1092  Don't know what you'll take unless you go in the longboat. Tell the
1093  men."
1094  
1095  "Beg pardon, sir; there's only me and the cook and two hands aboard.
1096  It'll take us all to pull the longboat."
1097  
1098  The steward had a slow, exasperating whine which always irritated Jack.
1099  
1100  "Then you'll have to take an oar," Jack responded roughly. "There's some
1101  one ashore waiting, and I said I'd send a boat. Get a move on. I'll
1102  watch ship."
1103  
1104  The steward went below grumbling, but soon reappeared with the cook and
1105  the two hands. With some delay they got off in the longboat, pulling
1106  wretchedly toward the shore and nagging at each other. As he stepped to
1107  the foot of the mainmast to take the halyards off the pins, Jack
1108  fervently thanked his stars for the heaviness of the boat and the
1109  evident fact that both cook and steward were hopeless duffers with an
1110  oar. He cleared the halyards with nervous fingers, stripped off the
1111  cover of the mainsail, and undid the canvas stops with which it was
1112  furled. Then he turned to the headsails, and had all clear before his
1113  ear again caught the sound of oars. He ran aft, and called out
1114  guardedly. Dave's voice answered him, and then he heard Taberman urging
1115  his companion to quicken his stroke. In the mist Castleport could dimly
1116  distinguish the heavy boats slowly nearing the yacht. It was all the men
1117  could do to get them alongside and make them fast astern. Once this was
1118  accomplished, all hands turned eagerly to the still harder labor of
1119  getting the Merle under weigh.
1120  
1121  "Jim," ordered Castleport, "skip along for'ard and take down that
1122  riding-light. Set it on deck so it won't show out-board. Dave, you get
1123  up the boat-boom. Haul it right up, 'thout minding the guys! Lively,
1124  now!"
1125  
1126  As Dave and Jim hurried forward to execute these orders, Jack himself
1127  stepped aft, took off the binnacle-cover, and got the lamps lit and in
1128  their places.
1129  
1130  "All hands for'ard on the anchor!" he sang out, rapping his shins on
1131  the cockpit combings as he scrambled out and ran along the deck. "We'll
1132  make sail when we get out the mudhook. 'F we try to get her mains'l up,
1133  they'll hear us all over the place. We'll drop down under heads'ls.
1134  Catch ahold there!"
1135  
1136  The Merle was riding at her port bower in some six fathoms of water. She
1137  had out a good bit of scope, however, and between the eight hands which
1138  gripped the quarter-inch chain and the anchor to which it was bent were
1139  some ten fathoms to be "handed over." In the light of the big Fresnel
1140  anchor-lantern upon the deck, the men, silent, rigid, braced back,
1141  strained steadily. For a full half-minute there was no gain whatever,
1142  but then one link of the chain came to the brazen lip of the hawse-hole
1143  with a sharp rap. The men grunted and hissed, bringing every muscle into
1144  play. Taberman was foremost on the chain. He faced the hawse-hole
1145  squarely, his legs wide apart, and his head thrown back. His face, even
1146  as seen by the white light of the Fresnel, was a dark brick-red, and out
1147  of the left corner of his mouth his tongue protruded. Dave was behind
1148  him, his left knee bent, and his right leg straight from toe to hip. He
1149  hung on savagely, his face unnaturally blank; his hair, damp with fog
1150  and sweat, clung to his brown forehead and temples. The third man was
1151  Jim, lying back in a strange posture, as though the small of his back
1152  were invisibly supported. His cheeks were white; his breathing was
1153  inaudible.
1154  
1155  With a little salvo of metallic snaps a scant dozen links more came in.
1156  Jack was last on the chain, and was separated from the man next him by a
1157  space greater than that between any other pair, so that he could when
1158  necessary take a turn of the slack about one of the brass-capped
1159  bollards at his side. His body was tense and rigid, his face and
1160  forehead full of odd puckers and lines. He was white at the lips, and
1161  the corners of his mouth were drawn down. His nose moved nervously with
1162  almost the suggestion of a rabbit's. One more link came in.
1163  
1164  "Better take it on the winch," gasped Jerry.
1165  
1166  "Damn it,--pull!" cried Jack.
1167  
1168  Jim grunted and Dave drew a breath through his closed teeth with a sharp
1169  whistling sound. Suddenly the chain rattled in so quickly that they
1170  could almost over-hand it. The Merle was moving at last.
1171  
1172  "Smartly!" Jack cried. "Smartly, and we'll make her trip it out
1173  herself."
1174  
1175  The four hauled lustily.
1176  
1177  "Nigh up and down," called Jerry.
1178  
1179  Jack threw a couple of bights of the chain over the bollard, and held
1180  it. The big yacht forged ahead slowly into the eye of the wind, carried
1181  along by the impetus given her by the handing of the chain. The bits
1182  creaked a little, the chain grew very taut and vibrant. The Merle
1183  checked up and began to drift back.
1184  
1185  "Now then!" cried Jack. "Lay along!"
1186  
1187  Each one of them grasped the chain with a fierce vigor, as a man might
1188  seize the throat of his enemy, while Jerry burst into an explosive
1189  whaling chantey, and the men fell into time with its rhythm.
1190  
1191  
1192       "Haul the bowline, the bowline, the bowline;
1193       Haul the bowline, the bowline,--_Haul!_"
1194  
1195  
1196  "Here she comes!" he shouted in the midst of a stave, as, all at once,
1197  the anchor was broken out.
1198  
1199  Jack dropped his end of the chain and ran aft to mind the wheel, leaving
1200  the men to take in the rest of the slack. The headsails were up in
1201  stops, but before breaking them out it was necessary to lay the yacht
1202  round on the port tack. As she was under sternway, Jack whirled the
1203  spokes over to port, and so--for her steering-gear was
1204  "balanced"--brought her head around to the southward. When he felt the
1205  wind on his left cheek, he put his hand to his mouth and shouted.
1206  
1207  "Break out fore-staysail!" he bellowed. "Trim it a-weather!--Hang on to
1208  the weather-sheet till she falls well off!"
1209  
1210  With a great slatting and booming of canvas the schooner payed off
1211  rapidly.
1212  
1213  "Catch on to that port sheet there!" shouted Jack. "Port, I say, port!
1214  Make fast! Not too flat! Give her all she'll use!"
1215  
1216  The Merle was now moving slowly before the wind.
1217  
1218  "Break out the jibs," ordered Jack, "both jibs! That's good. Make fast!"
1219  
1220  The wind had so freshened that the yacht began to move in earnest. At
1221  this juncture voices, faint but frantic, were heard hailing from astern.
1222  
1223  "Merle ahoy! Ahoy-oy-oy! Show--light! A-hoy-oy-oy--'board the Merle!"
1224  
1225  "Hear the steward?" called Jack to Jerry, who was at work with the
1226  head-sheet cleats.
1227  
1228  "Hear him!" laughed Jerry. "His music's a merry send-off."
1229  
1230  "Ahoy-oy-oy!" came the voice again, fainter and full of a dismayed
1231  distress that made them both break out afresh into derisive laughter.
1232  "Ahoy! Anchor! An-chor--Anch"--
1233  
1234  The despairing wail died away on the freshening wind.
1235  
1236  "Hope they won't poke round in the fog all night looking for the Merle,"
1237  Jack said gayly. "I never did like that steward, though."
1238  
1239  A moment or two later, as the yacht was nearing the entrance of the
1240  Thoroughfare, Jack called for Dave. The man came aft.
1241  
1242  "See here, Dave," Castleport asked, suddenly grown grave; "we've got
1243  more weather than we counted on. Can you pilot this yacht round Vinal
1244  Haven in this fog?"
1245  
1246  "Reck'n I kin, sir," Dave replied with pleasing assurance. "Man and boy
1247  I've worked round these shores twelve years."
1248  
1249  "Very well, then,--come down here and take her. Her gear's balanced: put
1250  the wheel over same way you want to swing her head. She's quick as a
1251  flash. If you want the chart"--
1252  
1253  But Dave shook his head with a grin.
1254  
1255  "Well, anyhow," said Jack, turning to leave him, "there's your compass."
1256  
1257  "That don't bother me none," replied the intrepid Dave, with a glance at
1258  once scornful and defiant at the smart binnacle. "I go mos' gin'rally by
1259  the smell," he added by way of explanation.
1260  
1261  "All right," laughed Jack. "Handle her carefully."
1262  
1263  "One thing, sir,--how much does she draw?"
1264  
1265  "Twelve feet," returned Jack.
1266  
1267  Then he stepped up on to the deck, and the Merle sped on into the black
1268  night.

1274  
1275  Chapter Four
1276  
1277  IT BLOWS NORTHWEST
1278  
1279  
1280  With Dave as her Palinurus the Merle ran down the wind until she was
1281  well outside the western entrance to the Thoroughfare. The headsails
1282  were then dropped, the yacht was put into the wind, and the mainsail was
1283  hoisted. The foresail was left furled, as the wind had freshened
1284  considerably, and the schooner started on a southerly course on the port
1285  tack.
1286  
1287  How Dave knew where he was or by what subtle instinct he was moved to
1288  give the Merle now a spoke or two to starboard or again to port, were
1289  mysteries as insoluble as complex. Taberman was lost in wonder at Dave's
1290  cool assurance; but to Jack, who knew of old the marvelous way in which
1291  the local fishermen handle their craft in the fog, the helmsman's skill,
1292  if wonderful, was yet no new thing.
1293  
1294  The beat to the Island was not, however, without incident. Twice, as
1295  they were tacking about in the thick fog, they ran close to wicked
1296  ledges over which the slow seas just rolled without breaking. At another
1297  point they came about just in time to avoid going ashore against a
1298  precipitous cliff which loomed high in the mist. Near the end of the run
1299  they worked into some shoal water where the uneasy heave and thrust of
1300  the sea made the schooner reel and stagger madly, while all about them
1301  was the thunder of unseen breakers. But in each and every peril Dave
1302  kept his head completely and brought the Merle through in safety.
1303  
1304  The passage was a busy one. Three times they luffed up in open water,
1305  and each time took a boat aboard. It was a difficult--almost a
1306  perilous--operation, but the night was flying and the boats dragged
1307  heavily. The foresail was made ready for hoisting, a reef being tucked
1308  into it without its being raised. The port bower was taken aboard;
1309  lanterns were got ready against the work which was to be done at the
1310  Island; a careful survey was made of the places available for stowage.
1311  Jack and Taberman made a list of the men, assigned watches and berths.
1312  They agreed that Gonzague, as cook, steward, and general major-domo,
1313  should have to himself the little cabin formerly occupied by the
1314  steward. To the men they gave the berths of the old crew; and in
1315  general arranged everything for the ocean voyage which had been left
1316  for adjustment until they should be actually on board. The personal
1317  effects of the President, his guests, the officers and the crew, they
1318  made ready to leave at the Island.
1319  
1320  "How about clothes for the men?" Taberman asked. "I never thought of
1321  that; and we should look like the deuce with a crew in fishermen's rigs.
1322  The police of any harbor in the world would be after us."
1323  
1324  "The uniforms belong to the yacht," Jack answered. "They are cut for the
1325  crew, but the men never own them."
1326  
1327  "Do you suppose those poor devils' traps will be safe at the Island?"
1328  
1329  "Safe as in a church."
1330  
1331  "But how'll they get 'em?"
1332  
1333  "Oh, by nine o'clock to-morrow morning the President will be on his way
1334  to the Island if he has to buy the Sylvia to go on. Camper'll tell him I
1335  ran away with the Merle, and he'll start to the Island to find me or get
1336  track."
1337  
1338  So they talked until, about two in the morning, the yacht ran past
1339  Hardwood Island, hauled her wind, and worked along to the southeast.
1340  Suddenly through the fog a dull red gleam showed on the weather bow.
1341  
1342  "There's Gonzague's bonfire," Jack cried. "You've brought us through,
1343  Dave, about as slick as anything ever was done in this world. 'Twas a
1344  tough job, too."
1345  
1346  The main-peak was dropped to lessen the yacht's way, and as the red
1347  flare became more distinct, the outer jibs were doused. Keeping the
1348  shore close aboard on the port side, the Merle ran along toward the
1349  ruddy blur of the fire, which was now seen to be burning at the end of a
1350  point. As the boat neared this point, Jack seized the megaphone, and
1351  putting the big cone to his lips, faced the fire, which was now abeam.
1352  
1353  "Hallo!" he roared. "Hallo, there! Gonzague!"
1354  
1355  A sudden and confused shouting out of the fog answered him. Then black
1356  figures, silhouetted against the red brightness of the fire and waving
1357  burning brands, ran to and fro with odd antics and caperings.
1358  
1359  "'Bout ship!" cried Dave. "'Ware boom! Douse the heads'ls!"
1360  
1361  The Merle came over on the other tack, and the staysail and jibs were
1362  run down. The main-sheet was then so started as to spill the wind out of
1363  the sail, and the yacht's way was quickly lessened. Having rounded the
1364  point, the schooner moved ahead sluggishly, again passing the bonfire
1365  on the port hand.
1366  
1367  "Stand by the anchor!" sang out Dave, as they ran by the end of the
1368  jetty.
1369  
1370  "Hooray!" yelled a chorus of voices from the pier. "Hooray, Dave!"
1371  
1372  Dave twirled the wheel to starboard, and the Merle came slowly into the
1373  eye of the wind, where he kept her until she seemed to be making
1374  sternway.
1375  
1376  "Well enough!" he shouted. "Let her go!"
1377  
1378  And the anchor-chain rattled down in three and a half fathoms.
1379  
1380  It was after two o'clock, and still thick. The wind, however, was
1381  hauling around to the southward, and the fog was beginning to thin a
1382  little. The main-sheet had hardly been hauled aft when some of the men
1383  were alongside in a boat. Jack stood by the steps, which had not been
1384  taken aboard during the run, while Tab, standing by his side, held a
1385  lantern. The first man aboard was Gonzague. Agile as an ape, for all his
1386  years, the old Provençal ran up the steps and touched his cap smartly,
1387  man-o'-war fashion.
1388  
1389  "I see you leaf in a great hoory, cap'n," he chuckled to Jack. "You 'av'
1390  loosed de matting of de step-grating, eh?"
1391  
1392  "Yes, rather," laughed Jack. "Pile aboard there," he added, addressing
1393  the men in the two boats now alongside.
1394  
1395  The new crew made their boats fast to the grating and came on board.
1396  
1397  "Now, then, all hands aft here for a minute," Jack ordered, when every
1398  one was assembled on deck.
1399  
1400  He knew that with such men as he had been able to collect for this
1401  expedition it was essential to bind them in some way. He had therefore
1402  prepared a paper in which were five articles for them to sign, and he
1403  was firmly resolved that unless they agreed to bind themselves, he would
1404  not trust the President's schooner to their care. The men were resolute
1405  in the face of danger, yet were unused to discipline; they were imbued
1406  with a crude sense of loyalty, but were unruly and quick to take
1407  offense; and unless they should consent at the outset to submit to his
1408  authority, Jack knew that little dependence could be put upon them.
1409  
1410  He instinctively assumed an arbitrary air,--almost dropping half
1411  consciously into the latent bully which lies hid in all strong
1412  characters. Had he reasoned it out, he would have adopted much the same
1413  tone as that which he took by instinct. These men, wild followers of
1414  the sea, would scorn to be led, and were to be mastered only by one who
1415  could browbeat and domineer,--who could, in their own word, "man-handle"
1416  them. They responded to the primitive necessity of seeing force in the
1417  man who is to command; and in showing his determination at the outset
1418  Jack was displaying at least one characteristic of a proper leader of
1419  men.
1420  
1421  He took from his pocket the list of names, and telling the men to answer
1422  to the roll he read it off by the light of Tab's lantern.
1423  
1424  "Elihu Coombs?" he read.
1425  
1426  "Here," answered a thickset lad with a rugged and weather-beaten face.
1427  
1428  "Here, SIR!" said Jack sharply, as he check'd off the name.
1429  
1430  "Edward Turner?"
1431  
1432  "Here, sir," answered a quiet voice on the outer ring of the men.
1433  
1434  "Haskell Dwight?"
1435  
1436  "Here, sir."
1437  
1438  They were all aboard: ten men, exclusive of Jack, Jerry, and Gonzague.
1439  When he had finished the list, Jack handed it to Jerry, and taking from
1440  his pocket a second paper,--the simple articles he had written,--he
1441  knocked the creases out of it with a back-handed rap, and then made a
1442  short speech.
1443  
1444  "My men," he began, "I don't want to haul you into any game with your
1445  eyes shut, so I've drafted articles for you to sign. Of course this
1446  whole business is only a joke, but it's got a serious side to it too.
1447  You can all see that plain enough; and it's my interest--and yours--to
1448  see to it that we don't have to laugh out of the wrong side of our
1449  mouths.
1450  
1451  "If you come on this cruise you'll sweat for your wages, now let me tell
1452  you! I'm not for grinding any man,--most of you know what I am, for
1453  you've seen me growing up from a kid,--but the yacht's got to be kept
1454  up, and that means that every man-jack aboard has got to keep as neat as
1455  a pin and not slight his job.
1456  
1457  "On the other hand, you men'll get a lot of experience in handling a
1458  larger vessel than you've been used to; you'll have good grub; and
1459  you'll see foreign ports. Top o' that, you draw good pay, and keep what
1460  clothes you can save.
1461  
1462  "Now then, these are the articles that every man who sails with me has
1463  got to put his name to."
1464  
1465  He read the whole paper, as distinctly and as impressively as he could.
1466  
1467  "Now," he concluded, "if any man here lacks the heart for this
1468  business, let him clear out. The rest of you, step up and sign."
1469  
1470  Jack laid the paper on the companion-hatch, and produced a fountain-pen,
1471  which he put beside it. Jerry was the first, in virtue of his position
1472  as mate, to put down his name. He set down his lantern and scrawled his
1473  signature at the foot of the articles in a hand that would have dwarfed
1474  that of John Hancock. He passed the pen to Gonzague, who, laboriously
1475  fisting it, wrote his name in a small, cramped hand, absurdly unlike the
1476  characters above it.
1477  
1478  For an instant--an appreciable instant--the rest hung back. Jack's brown
1479  eyes challenged theirs, and every one was very silent. That Castleport
1480  was seconded by those who were obviously attached to him gave the men,
1481  rather than confidence, an uneasy feeling of being another party, and
1482  this prompted an instinctive caution almost like antagonism. Had things
1483  been allowed to rest for a moment, the day might easily have been lost.
1484  Discussion might have arisen to beget argument and discord, explanations
1485  have been demanded, and the men have asked to be satisfied as to the
1486  real grounds on which Castleport was to be justified in appropriating
1487  his uncle's yacht and making off with it, a question which could hardly
1488  have been answered so as to satisfy everybody. At this unrealized
1489  crisis, old Gonzague quietly stepped among the men, passed a jest with
1490  one of them in an undertone, and so equilibrium was restored. He at once
1491  became one of them, and the vague idea of parties and opposition
1492  vanished into thin air before the men had had time even to recognize it.
1493  Dave stepped forward and signed, Jim followed him, and the rest of the
1494  men came after. Jack had sounded all of them separately before unfolding
1495  his plans, and the result was that not one of them drew back now. As the
1496  last one laid down the pen, Castleport spoke.
1497  
1498  "Before we fall to work I don't think anybody'd mind a good glass of
1499  grog; and while Gonzague's getting it, I just want to add one word to my
1500  say. I know this gentleman, Mr. Jerrold Taberman, to be a good
1501  navigator, and I've chosen him as my mate. Gonzague'll be cook and
1502  steward, and A1 you'll find him. I'm bound to make things go as easy as
1503  may be, and I will. I'm sure you'll do your duties, and you may bank on
1504  my doing mine."
1505  
1506  The grog being brought, Tab proposed the captain's health, and the crew
1507  drank it with enthusiasm. Jack emptied his glass to the "crew and a good
1508  cruise;" and then the entire company went to work, loading and stowing.
1509  
1510  Under Jerry's orders part of the crew began to carry provisions from
1511  the boathouse to the yacht, while under Jack's surveillance Gonzague and
1512  two of the crew stored what the others brought out. Gun-tackle purchases
1513  were rigged by the foremast to take the heavier cases aboard. The men
1514  worked feverishly, and almost without sound, as if subdued by the fear
1515  of being heard. At the end of a couple of hours the Merle had only to
1516  fill her water-tanks and she would be ready for sea. The fog was by this
1517  time so thin that in the dim light of the yet unrisen sun Jack, as he
1518  stood in the rigging, could discern vaguely the form of the house on the
1519  Island. As he was considering the weather, Gonzague, his face red with
1520  exertion and his usually immaculate clothes stained and torn, came up
1521  hastily.
1522  
1523  "Mistair Castleport, sair," he said, "I don' fin' any beeg funnel for de
1524  watter-tank. Dey mus' always feel dem from de watter-boat 'ose,--stick
1525  de en' into de deck-plate, I t'ink."
1526  
1527  "How's that?" exclaimed Jack. "No funnel?"
1528  
1529  The tender containing the first installments of the water-supply had
1530  already left the jetty, and Jack fell hastily to considering how the
1531  water was to be got out of the big unheaded casks into the tanks
1532  without its being dribbled in by the dipperful.
1533  
1534  "Did you look everywhere?" he demanded.
1535  
1536  "I look in de peak and go all de way aft to de run," replied the
1537  steward, "and all I find was de funnel in de kerosene-barrel. It ees too
1538  small, and it do fair reek wid de pairfume of de oil, sair."
1539  
1540  "Is there any piping aboard? any hose?" Jack asked. "We might siphon
1541  it."
1542  
1543  Gonzague shook his head, and at that moment the boat laden with water
1544  came alongside. Jack leaned over the rail.
1545  
1546  "I say, Jerry," he called out, "there's no funnel to fill the tanks
1547  with. How the deuce can we make water-stowage?"
1548  
1549  "Search me," returned Jerry with cheerful inelegance. "How should I
1550  know? Might use the megaphone."
1551  
1552  "You're a genius!" roared Jack. "It'll do to a T!"
1553  
1554  The keys were found, the caps unscrewed from the deck-plates, and the
1555  large papier-maché cone of the megaphone was set big-end-up over the
1556  orifice. Two men held it by the rim, while others kept it brimming with
1557  buckets of water bailed out of the casks. At the end of another hour
1558  both tanks were filled and the caps screwed down.
1559  
1560  The Merle was ready for her long cruise. Jack was well satisfied with
1561  the sufficiency of her stores, as in addition to the plain provisions
1562  which he and Taberman had provided, the yacht had been most abundantly
1563  victualed by the President for her summer's cruising.
1564  
1565  "Think of anything we've left, Jerry?" Jack asked.
1566  
1567  "The President?" Tab suggested.
1568  
1569  Jack's official seriousness went entirely to pieces at this suggestion,
1570  but he turned to the steward with an air of business.
1571  
1572  "Have you got everything, Gonzague?"
1573  
1574  "Yes, sair. I t'ink de leest is feel," the old man responded, closely
1575  regarding the dirty paper on which he had made his inventory and checked
1576  off each article as it came on board. Each item in the list had a black
1577  scratch beside it.
1578  
1579  "Well, then," the captain said, with a spark in his eye, "we're off!"
1580  
1581  He gave the word to clear the decks and to get under weigh.
1582  
1583  The wind had come around to the west, and was blowing fresh. They made
1584  all sail, however, chancing the gusty squalls which they were likely to
1585  meet off the high land of Isle au Haut, which they meant to leave on the
1586  starboard. The fog had gone entirely, except for long ghostly wreaths
1587  clinging to the dark green gullies of the Haut or encircling the distant
1588  mountain-tops of Mt. Desert; and when the sun rose clear and fair, all
1589  auspices seemed most cheeringly propitious.
1590  
1591  Jack took his departure from the Eastern Ear of the Haut, when it bore
1592  west-northwest three miles. At four that afternoon, when he and Jerry
1593  came on deck for time-sights, no land was to be seen.

1600  Chapter Five
1601  
1602  LAND HO!
1603  
1604  
1605  Some three weeks after the morning when the Merle left the Island, Jack
1606  and Tab were sitting in the saloon, working out the sights they had just
1607  taken for longitude. It was shortly after eight o'clock in the morning;
1608  the air was warm, and had in it a suggestion of the south. Through the
1609  open skylight came a shaft of light which cast a brilliant patch on the
1610  green cushions on the port side of the cabin. As the yacht rolled or
1611  pitched easily over the long seas, the patch of light moved about,--up,
1612  down, fore, aft; now it glanced on the rich red sheathing, now on the
1613  transom, and again on the big table.
1614  
1615  On the leeward side of this table the two men, dressed in canvas
1616  trousers and blue flannel shirts, were seated with their work lying
1617  before them. Between them lay several sheets of paper, parallel-rulers,
1618  the log-book in its brown duck cover, a copy of Norie open at the
1619  tables, and the American "Ephemeris." A large sheet-chart of the North
1620  Atlantic, weighted with a pair of binoculars, was spread in front of
1621  Jack. A heavy line, full of zigzags and acute angles, and running nearly
1622  across this chart, represented the Merle's track. Presently Jack laid
1623  down the pencil with which he had been figuring, and reaching out for
1624  the "Epitome," turned to the table of functions.
1625  
1626  "Through?" asked Tab, without looking up.
1627  
1628  "'Most," returned Jack, running one finger down a column of figures as
1629  he glanced first at his paper and then at the book. "I have it now," he
1630  added, and after jotting down a number he pushed the volume over to Tab,
1631  went to a cupboard on the port side, and brought back a case of
1632  instruments. He took out a pair of long-legged dividers, and with these
1633  and the parallel rulers he bent over the chart a minute or two, until
1634  the silence was again broken by Jerry.
1635  
1636  "What d' you get?" he asked.
1637  
1638  "Nine-eighteen-fifteen," replied Jack. "What's yours?"
1639  
1640  "Nine-sixteen-nought," answered Tab. "Wait a shake, I'll average them;"
1641  and he fell to figuring rapidly. "Mean is nine-seventeen-seven plus.
1642  Prick it off, and let's see where we're at--the D. R. latitude's
1643  thirty-six forty-eight."
1644  
1645  They bent together over the chart. Jack carefully manipulated rulers
1646  and dividers, found the point, and marked it in red ink.
1647  
1648  "She's making just over six knots now," he said. "We ought to make old
1649  Cape St. Vincent shortly. Let's put up these traps and go on deck."
1650  
1651  They stowed the things in their several lockers, and went out together.
1652  The Merle was running along with a quartering breeze, under all lower
1653  sails, sliding easily over the long swell on the port tack.
1654  
1655  "How about putting a lookout up aloft, Jack?" asked Tab. "We'll be
1656  raising the land pretty soon--if we're anywhere right in our reckoning,
1657  that is."
1658  
1659  "All right," agreed Jack. "Step down and get a pair of glasses; I fancy
1660  Hunter has the best eyes of any of the men. I'll get hold of him."
1661  
1662  Jerry disappeared below, and Jack walked along the windward side. The
1663  sea, rolling eastward in long, measured swells, reflected the sun from a
1664  myriad of glancing ripples that gleamed and glittered in the morning
1665  light. The sky, light blue and cloudless, looked like pale fire. On
1666  board the schooner the brass-work, as she rose and dipped in the troughs
1667  of the long seas, flashed and shone like burnished gold. The white
1668  canvas caught the sunshine, while on the decks, still undried from their
1669  recent scrubbing, the putty in the curving seams showed sharply white.
1670  The four boats were inboard, turned bottom up and cross-lashed to the
1671  rail.
1672  
1673  Castleport found the four men of the watch gathered in the peak, looking
1674  over the bows. He came up and saw that they were watching a school of
1675  dolphins that were keeping ahead of the yacht. The big fish seemed to
1676  vibrate. They sounded and leaped clear of the water, flashing and
1677  dripping with sparkling drops. A thousand colors rippled along their
1678  backs, as they turned and swayed, and they swung ahead like the very
1679  incarnation of frolic.
1680  
1681  The captain saw the man he wanted standing on the port side, and called
1682  him to him.
1683  
1684  "Hunter," he said, "go aft to Mr. Taberman; he'll give you a pair of
1685  glasses. Go aloft and keep a sharp lookout for land. We ought to raise
1686  it on the port bow."
1687  
1688  The effect produced by this order was electrical. The four men whipped
1689  around and stared at Jack and at each other.
1690  
1691  "Land!" exclaimed one with a foolish grin. "Land!"
1692  
1693  Hunter touched his duck hat and flew aft; Jack followed more leisurely.
1694  In a couple of minutes Hunter was ensconced in the foretop, eagerly
1695  scanning the eastern horizon. Castleport settled himself in the sun on
1696  the leeward side of the cockpit, and filled his pipe. He had hardly
1697  lighted it and taken half a dozen whiffs, when from aloft rang out the
1698  magical cry, "Land!"
1699  
1700  "Where away?" shouted the captain, leaping to his feet just as Tab
1701  appeared in the companion-way.
1702  
1703  "Have we raised it, Jack? Have we raised it?" Tab demanded excitedly.
1704  
1705  "Not yet, Tab. Just been sighted," returned Jack, peering up at the
1706  fore-crosstrees, and awaiting the lookout's answer to his hail.
1707  
1708  "'Bout two points off the weather-bow," sang out Hunter from aloft.
1709  "Just a low bank. Looks like cliffs through glasses!"
1710  
1711  "Come along, Tab!" cried Jack. "Let's go aloft and have a look at it."
1712  
1713  They made their way quickly along the deck, gained the weather-shrouds,
1714  and ran up. The watch below had turned out, just as they were,
1715  half-dressed and bareheaded. Two of the men had run out to the
1716  bowsprit's end, and holding on to the topmast stay were looking over the
1717  luff of the flying-jib. Old Gonzague, venerable as Vanderdecken, his
1718  white hair stirred by the wind,--for he was as usual without a cap,--had
1719  already gained the main-trees, where he stood shading his eyes with one
1720  hand while he gripped the shrouds with the other.
1721  
1722  "Where is it?" demanded Jerry, when he and Jack had reached the trees.
1723  
1724  "There away, sir," Hunter answered, pointing as he passed the glasses to
1725  the captain.
1726  
1727  With the unaided eye Jack and Jerry could discern, lying low on the
1728  eastern rim of the horizon, a faint brownish streak. With one arm about
1729  the topmast for support, Jack looked at the land through the glasses. At
1730  first, owing to the oscillation of the mast, he could not keep the brown
1731  streak in the field of vision, but in a moment he overcame this
1732  difficulty, and was able to make out a length of cliff of nearly uniform
1733  height, although split by numerous fjord-like bays. By its varied
1734  color--for he could see that the ribbon of shore was splashed with reds
1735  and blues--he decided that the land-fall was in the neighborhood of Cape
1736  St. Vincent.
1737  
1738  "Have a look?" he asked, passing the glasses to Tab. "It's the Painted
1739  Cape, fast enough,--or close to it."
1740  
1741  "What country is that, please, sir?" asked Hunter, in a tone almost of
1742  awe.
1743  
1744  "Portugal," the captain answered. "Sou'-western point of the land. We'll
1745  have Spain aboard before eight bells this afternoon."
1746  
1747  "By Grab, sir! Beg pardon, sir, but do them Portigee fishermen ye see to
1748  Boothbay an' Boston, do they come from hereaway?"
1749  
1750  "Here or from the islands,--Cape Verde, the Canaries, or the Azores;
1751  here for the most part. You may go below, if you want, Hunter."
1752  
1753  The man went, frequently pausing to look over his shoulder at the coast,
1754  glimpses of which could now be caught from the deck between the rolls.
1755  
1756  After a brief consultation, the captain and the mate followed Hunter,
1757  and went aft to consult the chart. As they passed along the deck, they
1758  noted that all hands were much excited. These men, used as they were to
1759  the sea, had been fishermen of the purely local sort, and it was
1760  doubtful if any one of them save Gonzague had ever before been out of
1761  sight of the high land of his native place; and here they were, in view
1762  of a strange country where the people spoke outlandish jabber, and, for
1763  all they knew to the contrary, went about in toggery as ridiculous as
1764  that of the Chinese laundrymen at Green's Landing. Discussion became
1765  all the more heated when Hunter came down and told them that the land
1766  was one of the countless possessions belonging to the "Portigee king."
1767  Frequent appeals were made to Gonzague, who had descended, and was the
1768  centre of an excited group. As Tab remarked, it was a sight worth
1769  remembering to see these self-contained New Englanders in such a state.
1770  
1771  Down below, Jack and Tab held a brief colloquy over the chart. They
1772  calculated, if the wind held, to make the Straits at nightfall, and run
1773  through by the aid of the lights on Cape Spartel and Tariffa. Having
1774  settled this point, they went on deck and had the course changed
1775  slightly.
1776  
1777  "By Jumbo!" cried Jerry, banging his fist on the deck as he stood in the
1778  cockpit, "by Jumbo, I can't sleep a wink with this land in sight.
1779  Portugal, too! By Jove, it's all very fine," he ran on, "for a _blasé_
1780  old globe-trotter like you to keep cool, but I'm fair dry with it all."
1781  
1782  Jack laughed, and reminded his friend of having lived in England and
1783  France, and of having traveled not a little in northern Europe.
1784  
1785  "Pooh!" sniffed Tab. "That's not really doing anything; everybody does
1786  that. And to think," he burst out, "that we brought ourselves! God bless
1787  me, Jacko, I little thought when you crammed me with navigation in
1788  vacation days aboard the old Luna that I'd ever use it all; really, that
1789  is, as we have used it these three weeks past."
1790  
1791  "Well, I hope you're duly grateful," laughed Jack. "It may prove a
1792  source of bread and butter if you're ever stranded."
1793  
1794  
1795  All that day the Merle ran along gallantly over the bright seas,
1796  occasionally passing ships of different nationalities bound in or out of
1797  the Straits. At sundown, although the bold coast of Morocco was not yet
1798  in sight, a lookout was sent aloft to watch for the light on Cape
1799  Spartel.
1800  
1801  At a little before nine o'clock in the evening, the breeze had so died
1802  down that the yacht hardly had steerage-way. Jack was asleep below; Tab
1803  had charge of the deck. What air there was was soft and warm. It had
1804  hauled around a couple of points against the sun, and was now fragrant
1805  with a faint tellurian odor, which would have been imperceptible to a
1806  landsman, but which was full of meaning to those who follow the sea.
1807  Overhead the great stars blazed in lustrous serenity. Their images kept
1808  appearing and vanishing on the now smooth and oily surface of the
1809  restless sea. The only sounds were those of the water and the
1810  cordage,--the sudden spanking of a big wave under the counter as the
1811  yacht flung her nose starward; the occasional crashing of the great
1812  booms and traveler-blocks as she righted suddenly after a heavy roll to
1813  port or a lurch to starboard; the pattering of the reef-points against
1814  the canvas; and the sharp reports made by the slatting of the lazy-jacks
1815  against the sails.
1816  
1817  In the west, growing smaller and smaller in the distance, the receding
1818  stern-light of an Italian steamship glimmered faintly. Taberman watched
1819  it long after it kept sinking out of sight and again rising in the
1820  weltering seas, and until it at last vanished as if quenched. He was
1821  following out certain grim speculations as to the feelings of a forsaken
1822  swimmer who should watch this star of his hope moving relentlessly away
1823  into the west, grower fainter each time it emerged from the waves,
1824  when--
1825  
1826  "Light ho!" shouted the lookout from the darkness aloft.
1827  "There's--light; 'bout--point--off--starb'd--bow!"
1828  
1829  "What kind?" hailed Jerry from the deck, straining his eyes to where, a
1830  dim blot against the stars, the figure of the lookout could be discerned
1831  standing by the rigging on the cross-trees.
1832  
1833  "Fixed white, red flash," called the man.
1834  
1835  "All right," shouted Jerry; and added in his ordinary tone of command
1836  to the hands on deck: "Lay along, now! Trim in main-sheet a bit--well
1837  enough. Now then, fore and head sheets. Good. That'll do.--We want to
1838  get what air there is," he added to himself.
1839  
1840  Although the wind was slight, yet about the Straits is always a
1841  strongish set of current. The surface current flows into the
1842  Mediterranean continuously, and it kept setting the Merle steadily
1843  ahead. When Taberman judged the light to be no more than five or six
1844  knots away, he sent below to rouse the captain, who was asleep. When
1845  Castleport came on deck, the bearing of the light was taken, the chart
1846  consulted, and a slight change made in the course. It was now calm, and
1847  the yacht, no longer steadied by the wind, rolled heavily.
1848  
1849  "We ought to see it air up before long," remarked Jack, after a short
1850  silence. "It's so beastly calm now. When it's calm on one side of the
1851  Straits, it's always blowing on the other. An Italian sea captain told
1852  me there is always just so much air about here, and however much or
1853  little is on one side, the balance is always kicking about on the
1854  other."
1855  
1856  "Then we'll take the sticks out of her, once we're through the
1857  Straits," Jerry responded with conviction.
1858  
1859  As the schooner entered the Straits, the blue-black sky to the eastward
1860  became dimly albescent, and shortly a blood-red moon rose slowly behind
1861  the inky mass of Monkey Mountain. The huge pile of rock, the more
1862  impressive though the less famous of the Pillars of Hercules, loomed
1863  vast, mysterious, and perdurable in the soft darkness. The waves, as the
1864  face of the moon cleared, were lit with a gray light.
1865  
1866  Suddenly, as a long, smooth swell shouldered the yacht past the edge of
1867  a small promontory, they opened out the lights of Tangiers on the
1868  starboard beam. The moon as yet illuminated only the western half of the
1869  scarped bowl in which lie the little villas which surround the town. The
1870  scattered lights on the east side of the valley were accentuated by the
1871  surrounding gloom.
1872  
1873  "There's Tangiers," cried Jack. "There's old Tangiers."
1874  
1875  "Those lights?" asked Jerry. "What sort of a place is it?"
1876  
1877  "Jolly little hole. All white and pink in the daytime, with red tile
1878  roofs. Hot as Tophet, though. There's Tariffa, boy! That's Tariffa over
1879  there."
1880  
1881  They excitedly discussed the points along their way. To Jerry it was
1882  all new, but Jack had traveled a good deal about the Mediterranean, and
1883  was well able to play the mentor. For an hour they talked, and the Merle
1884  drifted with the current; but they had not passed out of the shadow of
1885  Monkey Mountain before a faint breath of air stirred the headsails. It
1886  came stealing down out of the upper canvas, hot and dry.
1887  
1888  "By Jove!" cried Jack, "we'll have all the wind we want in a bit. You
1889  can tell how hard it is blowing outside the Straits by the distances it
1890  reaches in."
1891  
1892  Then he raised his voice, and called to the watch,--
1893  
1894  "Hello there! Clew up the topsails! Pass gaskets on them!"
1895  
1896  The men, who had a dog-like trust in the captain, obeyed quickly, though
1897  from the remarks they interchanged _sotto voce_ it was easy to see that
1898  the order puzzled them. When everything was made snug aloft, Jack had a
1899  reef tucked in the main and foresails, and the outer headsails stowed.
1900  
1901  Still no wind. The schooner slowly moved along the edge of the great
1902  shadow of the mountain, only her topmast trucks and the peak of her
1903  mainsail silvered by the moonlight.
1904  
1905  A dull, hoarse whisper, faint and continuous, was now audible ahead. It
1906  grew louder by very slow degrees, and Jerry, unused as he was to
1907  Mediterranean weather, knew it for the roar of a mighty wind. In the
1908  moonlight ahead the waters appeared troubled, the hard-heaving seas
1909  being strangely and almost weirdly demarked from the calm in which the
1910  Merle rolled forward languidly. All at once, as the yacht emerged from
1911  the obscurity of the mountain's shadow, a sudden gust of warm air struck
1912  her without warning, and heeled her lee-rail under.
1913  
1914  "Hard down!" roared Jack.
1915  
1916  Jerry leaped to the wheel, and it took all the force of himself and the
1917  helmsman to put the helm hard-a-lee. The Merle righted, and being
1918  unusually quick, flew into the eye of the wind. From the threshing sails
1919  came a thunderous volley of heavy boomings. The sheet-blocks were
1920  whipped to and fro with such violence that twice Jack saw red sparks
1921  struck from the fore-traveler guard. Then, as suddenly as it had come,
1922  the wind left, and it was only by the way she had gathered that the
1923  helmsman could pay the yacht off.
1924  
1925  "We are going to catch it for fair," Jack said. "Best dowse the foresail
1926  entirely, I fancy. Pass the word along to Gonzague to make all snug
1927  below. Jerry, step into the cabin and make sure of the course from off
1928  Ceuta to Port Mahon."
1929  
1930  "Right-o," answered Jerry briskly, diving down.
1931  
1932  "Get down the fores'l!" shouted the captain to the men.
1933  
1934  "Helm up a bit there--steady! That's the talk! Get all the stops
1935  on.--Now then--make fast that sheet there."
1936  
1937  The Merle was hardly on her course again when a second squall struck
1938  her. Her canvas having been reduced, however, the helmsman kept her
1939  broadside to it. The yacht's strongest point was the quickness with
1940  which she gathered way, and on this occasion, when nine tenths of her
1941  class would simply have lain over and quivered, she rushed ahead with
1942  the fury of an avenging goddess. When the hot flaw left her, she was at
1943  the very last verge of the calm water.
1944  
1945  "Stand by the main-sheet to square off when she meets it!" shouted Jack.
1946  
1947  The men had hardly time to get to their stations before a third squall
1948  caught the Merle and sent her tearing over the line into the full
1949  strength of the wind. The air, hot from the desert, and laden with fine,
1950  parching dust, sang in the shrouds and the running-rigging. It slashed
1951  the salt spindrift in the smarting faces of the men. The seas grew
1952  suddenly confounding in size; huge weltering masses--tons--of greenly
1953  black water wallowed without rhythm all about the yacht, up as high as
1954  the light-boards. To a landsman it would have seemed impossible that
1955  thus scourged by the sirocco across these maddened seas the schooner
1956  should escape destruction.
1957  
1958  The sheets were started, the yacht was paid off before the wind, and
1959  began the last stretch of her run. Tab came on deck with the course,
1960  staggering and holding on, and shouted it into Jack's ear. Jack nodded,
1961  and gave orders for setting it, a fresh departure being taken from the
1962  light on the mole at Ceuta.
1963  
1964  The Merle ran close in on the eastern side of Gibraltar. The great rock,
1965  sheer and silver-gray in the moonlight, rose out of the raging seas
1966  which ringed it about with a zone of roaring breakers. Grimly
1967  self-reliant, it stood grand, silent, stupendous, unassailable in the
1968  midst of the turmoil and uproar. As the yacht raced by, staggering under
1969  her reefed canvas, Taberman regarded the rock, in face of which their
1970  craft seemed a mere mote on the blast, with a feeling as near awe as it
1971  is possible for buoyant youth to feel. He did not speak until the Merle
1972  had swept past the rock-hewn fortress. Then he drew a deep breath and
1973  bent over so that Jack could hear him amid the hissing of the sirocco.
1974  
1975  "That's immense, Jack, isn't it?" he said.
1976  
1977  Without taking his eyes from the throat of the mainsail he was watching
1978  as a physician at a crisis watches the pulse of a patient, Jack nodded a
1979  deep assent.
1980  
1981  At times the Merle seemed fairly to leap like a flying fish from one
1982  wave-crest to the next in her northeasterly flight.

1991  DINNER ASHORE
1992  
1993  
1994  On a Thursday afternoon in the middle of July, the Merle dropped anchor
1995  behind the inner mole of Nice. In her course northward from the Straits,
1996  she had passed to the eastward of the Baleares, crossed the Gulf of
1997  Lyons, and run smoothly into harbor before the same powerful wind that
1998  had greeted her so boisterously on her entrance into the Middle Sea.
1999  
2000  The moment when the port officer came aboard had been a nervous one, but
2001  the dapper little official had merely glanced at the yacht's papers,
2002  complimented the captain on his seamanship, and then gone ashore without
2003  a sign of suspicion.
2004  
2005  The yacht had no sooner been made trig and ship-shape, her sails stopped
2006  with "harbor furl," the canvas covers on, the boats unlashed and swung
2007  on the davits, the running-rigging coiled down, and the details proper
2008  to coming into port attended to, than Jack, unable to put off going
2009  ashore until the morrow, gave orders for the crew to turn out in their
2010  best attire. Then with Taberman he went below to array himself for the
2011  land. In Castleport's mind the idea of calling on Mrs. Fairhew and Miss
2012  Marchfield, who he knew should now be in Nice, was paramount to all
2013  else. He would see Mrs. Fairhew, he would see Katrine, and then--well,
2014  then it would be time to consider.
2015  
2016  Once below, Jack and Jerry began the overhauling of their wardrobes,
2017  doing their dressing half in their staterooms and half in the cabin,
2018  that they might go on with afternoon tea at the same time. During the
2019  voyage they had gone about most of the time in flannel shirts and duck
2020  trousers, the only two rules in regard to toilet having been that they
2021  should shave regularly, and that they should not come to dinner in
2022  oilers, no matter what the weather. The first rule had been framed by
2023  Jack; and Tab, as author of the second, had declared that he would
2024  rather eat hardtack in his pajamas, than a six-course dinner in his
2025  oilers. Now, as they stood in the doors of their staterooms examining
2026  their shore clothing,--each holding, like the Hatter at the trial of the
2027  Knave of Hearts, a teacup in his hand,--they had the air of being almost
2028  surprised at finding themselves in possession of so many garments, or
2029  of not knowing exactly what to do with them.
2030  
2031  "Got any extra duck trow-trows, Jack?" asked Jerry. "We made a great
2032  mistake not shipping a laundress along with the other stores."
2033  
2034  "Hanging them up on the rigging to dry doesn't give them an extra fine
2035  polish," Jack returned. "I have two pairs I've been saving for shore,
2036  and I suppose I can sacrifice one of them on the altar of friendship."
2037  
2038  "That's truly noble of you," Tab said, coming over to Jack's cabin after
2039  the clean ducks; "but it's all right. When we go ashore we'll take
2040  Gonzague and a bag of things, and have some real washing done on land.
2041  What's that official-looking envelope?"
2042  
2043  From the pocket of a coat which Castleport had thrown aside in his
2044  search for the desired garment, a long blue envelope, still sealed, had
2045  fallen to the floor. Jack pounced upon it, with an exclamation of
2046  dismay.
2047  
2048  "Great guns!" he exclaimed. "It's Uncle Randolph's mail!"
2049  
2050  "It's what?"
2051  
2052  "Why," the captain explained, rummaging in the pocket from which the
2053  letter had fallen and producing a couple of others, "I told you about
2054  the boy's bringing out the letters to the Merle while she was changing
2055  crews at North Haven."
2056  
2057  "You mean the letters the boy brought out for the President?"
2058  
2059  "Yes, damn it!" responded the other, regarding the letters with a
2060  troubled brow. "This is a pretty kettle of fish. Uncle Randolph's
2061  letters are apt to be important, and this one has a beastly official
2062  look. It's sure to be something that couldn't wait. It's probably the
2063  thing he was looking for when he gave orders to have his mail brought
2064  out to him."
2065  
2066  "'If not delivered in five days return to R. B. Tillington, 57 State
2067  Street, Boston,'" read Jerry over his shoulder. "Tillington's the
2068  zinc-mine man, isn't he?"
2069  
2070  "Zinc, copper, gold,--any old thing that you can make a mining
2071  speculation out of. I think he's a slippery old fraud, but he's hand in
2072  glove with Uncle Randolph; or rather they have a lot of business
2073  together. Uncle Randolph thinks Tillington wouldn't dare to play him
2074  false, but he's an eely old beggar. Anyhow, this letter may mean the
2075  making or the losing of a fortune for all I know. Gad! Running away with
2076  his yacht is nothing to going off with his letters!"
2077  
2078  "I don't suppose it would do to mail them here?" suggested Jerry.
2079  
2080  "That would dish us all right," Jack answered. "It would give us away by
2081  the postmark. Uncle Randolph isn't likely to think of our coming across.
2082  He can't know we were provisioned, and he very likely thinks we are
2083  still knocking about on the other side of the Atlantic."
2084  
2085  "He might find out about the stores by asking at the express offices and
2086  that sort of thing."
2087  
2088  "Why should he, unless something puts the idea into his head?"
2089  
2090  "I suppose he wouldn't," Jerry assented thoughtfully. "How would it do
2091  to return this letter to Tillington?"
2092  
2093  "Just as bad as to send it direct to Uncle Randolph. Once let them know
2094  at home where we are, and we are done for fast enough."
2095  
2096  "Well," Taberman said, after a brief pause in which he had apparently
2097  been summing up the situation in his mind, "the harm's done by this
2098  time, anyway; and I don't see that there's anything for us but to stick
2099  to our guns, blow high, blow low. We'll mail 'em when we get ready to go
2100  back."
2101  
2102  Castleport regarded the letters in his hand gravely.
2103  
2104  "I suppose there's nothing else to do," he said slowly. "The Merle is
2105  of course registered at Lloyd's, and he'd only have to cable over to
2106  have us nabbed anywhere along the whole coast."
2107  
2108  "He may see the arrival in the shipping-lists as it is, I should think,"
2109  Jerry observed rather gloomily.
2110  
2111  "Of course; but we've got to run our chances on that. He's not very much
2112  in the habit of studying the sailing-lists as far as I know, but he may
2113  do it now. Anyway we've got to run for luck."
2114  
2115  "The luck has been pretty good so far," was Jerry's consoling
2116  observation; "and I won't begin to distrust it now."
2117  
2118  The result of the conversation was that the letters were put carefully
2119  away, and the two adventurers resolved not to worry about them.
2120  Castleport admitted that the matter troubled him not a little, but he
2121  was under the circumstances disposed to accept his comrade's very
2122  sensible observation that after all the letters might be of no especial
2123  importance.
2124  
2125  "You see," Jerry said, with a laugh, as he gulped down the last of his
2126  tea, which had had time to become thoroughly cold, "we are really
2127  pirates, and here you go bringing the conscience of a gentleman into the
2128  business. None of that."
2129  
2130  Castleport laughed, and once more their attention was given to dressing
2131  for the shore.
2132  
2133  No one aboard understood the care and manipulation of the small
2134  steam-launch which the President used on state occasions, so they went
2135  ashore in the big cutter, with six men to pull and old Gonzague in
2136  charge.
2137  
2138  They landed at the quays, and left Gonzague to act as interpreter and
2139  mentor to the men, while they took their way across the Quay Rosaglio
2140  and along the narrow Rue Paglione. They came out soon upon the Promenade
2141  des Anglais, thronged, in spite of the time of year, with foreigners of
2142  many nationalities. Delicate French ladies in the latest fashions from
2143  Paris, were here escorted by anæmic gentlemen looking absurdly out of
2144  place in evening dress; vulgar Teutons in baggy trousers with impossibly
2145  dowdy wives, legitimate evolutions from generations of sauerkraut and
2146  beer; now and then an unmistakable "remittance man" from England, with
2147  puffy eye-sockets and brutal face, accompanied by the companion paid by
2148  some noble family to take charge of the prodigal till he drank himself
2149  into a dishonored grave; the British cleric, too, with the inevitable
2150  string of hopelessly dull daughters tagging after him like bobs on a
2151  kite; swarthy Roumanians or Swabians; Russians deep-eyed and surrounded
2152  by an almost palpable atmosphere of haughtiness; in a word, the
2153  cosmopolitan crowd of a fashionable promenade of Southern Europe.
2154  Through such a throng Jack and Jerry made their way toward the centre of
2155  the foreign element of the better sort, the Hôtel des Anglais.
2156  
2157  As they reached their destination, Jack became visibly excited, and made
2158  his way to the office with an air of determination vastly amusing to his
2159  companion. He was on the point of asking for Mrs. Fairhew when he was
2160  startled by a voice behind him.
2161  
2162  "Why, Mr. Castleport!"
2163  
2164  Her voice! Jack spun around like a teetotum.
2165  
2166  "Katrine--Miss Marchfield!" he cried. "How do you do? I--I-- You know, I
2167  came here--this minute--I was just going to ask if you were here."
2168  
2169  "Well," laughed the lady, whose heightened color and shining eyes were
2170  evidences of a pleasant excitement, "you see I am.--Oh, Mr. Taberman,
2171  how do you do? I'm delighted to see you."
2172  
2173  "How are you?" responded Jerry, taking her slim hand in his own hard
2174  paw. "It's awfully jolly to see you here. How's Mrs. Fairhew? Well, I
2175  hope."
2176  
2177  "Yes, thank you," answered Katrine. "She's never better than when she's
2178  traveling, you know."
2179  
2180  Miss Katrine Marchfield was one of those girls who, though not
2181  beautiful, are more than pretty. She was too attractive to be fairly
2182  disposed of by being credited with mere prettiness; yet she had not
2183  fully that quality, august and indefinable, which confers upon the
2184  fortunate possessor real beauty. She was slightly above medium height,
2185  and could now, having been out for a couple of winters, carry herself
2186  exquisitely. A beautiful figure could not have been denied her by the
2187  most envious rival; and her fairly broad shoulders, always drawn well
2188  back, gave her a charming air of delicately athletic power. Her face, at
2189  first merely piquant,--perhaps from the slight arching of her eyebrows
2190  and the wholly delightful way in which she carried her head,--showed at
2191  a second glance, by the height of the forehead, the clear chiseling of
2192  the features, and the intelligent sympathy of the gray eyes, a true and
2193  sensitive nobility of nature which gave to her countenance a charm at
2194  once fine and abiding. Her eyes Jack--and for that matter a score of
2195  adoring youths--considered her greatest beauty. They were at times
2196  thoughtful, at others sparkling with vivacity. Now and then they might
2197  be surprised in a quickly vanishing expression wistful or even almost
2198  sad, as if some deeper self looked out but did not will to be seen. A
2199  mouth small, the upper lip a trifle fuller than the under; a nose almost
2200  Greek; and above the high forehead a cloud of dusky brown hair,--these
2201  physical attributes, with a sympathetic temperament and a mind sensible
2202  yet deliciously feminine, a pleasant voice and a delightful laugh, had
2203  won for Katrine Marchfield more conquests than could be boasted by many
2204  an older woman of really marked beauty.
2205  
2206  Her relations with Jack Castleport, whether she had admitted it to
2207  herself or not, had for some time been greatly different from those she
2208  held with any one else. They had met at a dinner shortly after Katrine,
2209  for two years doubly orphaned, had come from Philadelphia to live with
2210  her widowed aunt, Mrs. Fairhew, in Boston. After meeting Katrine,
2211  Castleport had taken to calling at Mrs. Fairhew's, at first nominally to
2212  see the aunt and later frankly to see the niece. He was at this time a
2213  Junior at Harvard, and a popular man on both sides of the river; the
2214  acquaintance during his Senior year had ripened into friendship, and the
2215  most important feature of Class Day for Jack was the presence of Miss
2216  Marchfield; he had thought more of her in the audience than of the
2217  dignitaries on the platform when on Commencement Day he had taken his
2218  degree; and what with dancing with Katrine, driving with Katrine, and
2219  dreaming of Katrine for the winter which lay between Harvard and this
2220  summer, he had come to measure the uses of life chiefly as they might
2221  help to make her care for him or to reveal to him what were her feelings
2222  toward him.
2223  
2224  For a moment or two the three Americans stood talking near the desk of
2225  the hotel. Then Miss Marchfield stepped forward and dropped into the
2226  mail-box some letters she was carrying.
2227  
2228  "If you'll excuse me one minute," she said, "I'll send for Aunt Anne,
2229  and see about dinner. Of course you'll stay to dine?"
2230  
2231  "Delighted," Jack said. "That is," he added, "if it's all right for us
2232  in these clothes. You see, we stupidly came off without evening togs."
2233  
2234  "That's all right," Katrine returned; and went away smiling.
2235  
2236  Jack looked after her with an expression which made Jerry smile.
2237  
2238  "Gad! She's looking ten times better than when she left home," Tab said
2239  in an undertone.
2240  
2241  "She always does," the captain responded with fervent fatuousness. "She
2242  can't help it, you know. God bless me," he added with equal fervor and
2243  absurdity, "it's worth coming over steerage just to hear her voice!"
2244  
2245  "Well, you _are_ hit!" commented his friend; and then, seeing a shade
2246  come over Jack's face, he laid his hand on his friend's shoulder, and
2247  added: "Don't mind my chaff, old man. I really wish you all kinds of
2248  luck."
2249  
2250  Jack gave him a flash of sympathy and understanding, and then turned his
2251  head aside.
2252  
2253  "Pity we haven't got evening slops," Jerry remarked, by way of changing
2254  the conversation; "but I suppose we'll do, seeing the way we came over,
2255  and all that."
2256  
2257  "I'm not worrying about clothes," returned the captain of the Merle.
2258  "Men wear all sorts of things traveling. I'm thinking what Mrs.
2259  Fairhew'll say about our being here in the yacht without Uncle
2260  Randolph."
2261  
2262  "What's your game if we're quizzed about the President?"
2263  
2264  "I'm hanged if I really know," Jack returned; "but I've got to pull it
2265  through somehow, and you'll have to follow my lead."
2266  
2267  He had time to say no more, for Katrine came forward to rejoin them, and
2268  before she had reached the friends, Mrs. Fairhew appeared.
2269  
2270  Mrs. Fairhew was a striking woman of some forty years, of medium
2271  height, with quick and alert bearing, with the unmistakable air of a
2272  well-bred woman of the world. A widow of some six years, she still,
2273  except upon occasions of particular state, wore black,--from devotional
2274  feeling, according to her friends, and, according to the captious,
2275  because it so well became her. Between her and her niece existed a
2276  subtle and baffling likeness, but in what it consisted one would have
2277  found it well-nigh impossible to say. Of good birth, perfect breeding,
2278  and a wide social experience, she possessed also an intellect naturally
2279  good and improved by careful training; while for her rare good taste she
2280  was perhaps equally indebted to nature and to a somewhat old-fashioned
2281  training in whatever is best in the English classics. With these good
2282  gifts and graces and a perfect poise, she combined whatever is most
2283  admirable in the best type of American gentlewoman.
2284  
2285  "Mr. Castleport," she said, giving that gentleman her hand with gracious
2286  cordiality, "this is an unexpected pleasure! How do you do, Mr.
2287  Taberman. I am very glad to see you both."
2288  
2289  Greetings were exchanged, and then, after a moment's chatting, the men
2290  gave over their hats to an attendant, and the party went into the
2291  dining-room. On account of the season, the number of people at the
2292  hotel was comparatively small, and the huge _salle à manger_, with its
2293  slim pilasters and its long French windows, its tubs of palmetto and
2294  oleander, might have impressed Jack and Jerry as rather barn-like and
2295  forsaken had either been in the mood to find anything in their
2296  surroundings unsatisfactory. The four made their way to a small square
2297  table in an alcove, behind which stood a tall, round-shouldered waiter
2298  in an antediluvian dress-suit. Jack put Katrine into her chair and was
2299  placed next her, and with much pleasant talk the party began dinner.
2300  
2301  The fish was served before any mention was made of the President. Then
2302  Jack suddenly found himself in dangerous waters, owing to a random
2303  remark from Mrs. Fairhew.
2304  
2305  "And Mr. Drake?" she asked. "What a pity he didn't come too. I suppose
2306  he couldn't get away."
2307  
2308  "Not on the Merle," responded Jack. "It takes a long time to cross on
2309  such a small boat."
2310  
2311  Jerry watched his friend closely to detect signs of embarrassment, but
2312  was able to perceive nothing more than a faint flush in the brown
2313  cheeks. He recalled the captain's words about following his lead, and at
2314  this point, in his own picturesque phraseology, "shoved in his oar."
2315  
2316  "Besides," he said glibly, with a secret mischievous glee at feeling
2317  Jack's anxious eye upon him, "it's so hard to get the President away
2318  from his everlasting bridge,--_Pons Asinorum_, I call it. When we left
2319  North Haven he was so absorbed in his game that he didn't even see us
2320  off."
2321  
2322  "I didn't know he was so attached to cards," Mrs. Fairhew commented,
2323  with a smile. "As you have the yacht, Mr. Taberman, you should at least
2324  speak well of the bridge that has brought you over."
2325  
2326  "Did Mr. Drake put you two in charge of his sailing-master, Mr.
2327  Taberman?" asked Katrine, with a suspicion of a glance at Jack, as if
2328  she meant to tease him.
2329  
2330  "No," returned Jerrold. "Jack and I did the navigating; he's a past
2331  master, I assure you."
2332  
2333  "Yes," rejoined Katrine, "but I should have fancied he would have had
2334  some one that was--Well, some one with a professional experience, you
2335  know."
2336  
2337  "If the idea struck him he didn't mention it," put in Jack. "If it
2338  occurred to him after we left, I can't tell, as I haven't heard from
2339  him."
2340  
2341  "Haven't heard from him!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairhew in mild surprise.
2342  "Haven't you been to your bankers?"
2343  
2344  "Haven't been anywhere except at this hotel," Jack returned sturdily;
2345  and then added: "It was after bank hours when we came ashore."
2346  
2347  "Of course you cabled him your arrival?"
2348  
2349  "Mercy! I might have done that, mightn't I? Upon my word, it never
2350  occurred to me."
2351  
2352  "Thoughtful of you," Katrine commented demurely.
2353  
2354  "Well, I did get some letters ready to send to him," Jack protested,
2355  while Jerry grinned broadly.
2356  
2357  "Got them ready! How like a man!" laughed Mrs. Fairhew. "A woman would
2358  have had them ready before she saw land, and had them mailed by the time
2359  the anchor was down."
2360  
2361  "So did Jack have them ready," put in Jerry imperturbably.
2362  
2363  "Then it's doubly dreadful that they are not posted," retorted Mrs.
2364  Fairhew.
2365  
2366  Jack leaned forward and settled a pink candle-shade that threatened a
2367  conflagration, and by a comment on the inflammability of these table
2368  ornaments managed to bring the conversation into safer channels.
2369  
2370  In the course of the talk it transpired that the ladies had no very
2371  definite plans, except that Mrs. Fairhew had determined, despite the
2372  heat of the Italian summer, to visit an old school friend, whose
2373  husband was vice-consul at Naples.
2374  
2375  "I fancy," she said, "that we shall go straight to Genoa. I'm going to
2376  make Katrine work, and to see that she does her duty by the galleries
2377  and things,--Florence and all the Tuscan cities, you know. Then Rome and
2378  the Campagna. It will be dreadfully hard on us both, I dare say, but we
2379  shall be upheld by the proud consciousness of doing our best."
2380  
2381  She made a little gesture of comical despair, and her niece laughed.
2382  
2383  "It would doubtless be intolerable to either of you without the other,"
2384  said Jerry in one of his boyishly elaborate attempts to be gallant.
2385  
2386  Mrs. Fairhew regarded him with a glance well-bred though quizzical, but
2387  evidently perceived that he was completely sincere in his desire to say
2388  something agreeable, and smiled, although less broadly than Katrine, who
2389  showed in her amusement a row of beautiful teeth.
2390  
2391  "Won't it be pretty hot in the south?" asked Jack. "I've never been in
2392  Naples in summer, nor south of Rome, in fact; but I've always been told
2393  that it is too torrid for foreigners."
2394  
2395  "Oh, we are used to it," Mrs. Fairhew returned. "Besides, it is after
2396  all the English that have spread the stories about Italy's being so
2397  hot. They've been kept at so low a temperature all their lives by their
2398  horrid fogs that they're the greatest babies imaginable about climate."
2399  
2400  "I fancy you're right," assented Jack. "At all events, as you are used
2401  to all climates, and as Miss Marchfield comes from Philadelphia"--
2402  
2403  "Oh, but I've never been there in summer," Katrine broke in. "And,
2404  besides, I've lived in Boston so long that"--
2405  
2406  "That you can stand anything?" interrupted Jerry in turn.
2407  
2408  "I think I can," laughed Katrine.
2409  
2410  Mrs. Fairhew toyed with her coffee-spoon thoughtfully a moment; then she
2411  looked up at Jack.
2412  
2413  "Where are you bound, Mr. Castleport?" she asked.
2414  
2415  "I don't know," Jack answered quite frankly. "I think we shall probably
2416  coast along--Monaco, Bordighera, and Mentone, you know; and then go to
2417  Genoa. Then perhaps we'll see Elba and Naples and Capri. After that we
2418  must start for home. Nothing is settled with us."
2419  
2420  "I detest Monaco," Mrs. Fairhew said, with some irrelevance.
2421  
2422  "Why?" inquired Jack, with a smile. "Does the gambling offend the
2423  Puritan that is in every Bostonian?"
2424  
2425  "It certainly does," was the reply, "though my aversion isn't entirely a
2426  matter of conscience. I bought it on the spot for a thousand francs."
2427  
2428  "That was awfully dear," remarked Jerry. "It would have been much
2429  cheaper to be born with it."
2430  
2431  "As in your case?" asked the lady, raising her eyebrows a little and
2432  smiling.
2433  
2434  "Oh, one can't inherit all the virtues!" responded Taberman with the
2435  greatest seriousness.
2436  
2437  "Most certainly not," laughed Mrs. Fairhew. "At least I had not that
2438  good fortune."
2439  
2440  "Nature left you one to get for yourself, because she knew you'd do it
2441  so easily," Tab said gallantly.
2442  
2443  "Really," cried the lady, "you are evidently determined to overwhelm me,
2444  Mr. Taberman. Compliments drop from your lips like the traditional
2445  showers of pearls."
2446  
2447  "There are frogs too in that fairy story," suggested Jack.
2448  
2449  "Oh, Mr. Castleport," declared Katrine, coming to the rescue of Jerry,
2450  "that is simply brutal."
2451  
2452  "Of course it's brutal," retorted Jack, willfully twisting her meaning,
2453  "but he keeps it up all the same."
2454  
2455  Jerry tried to defend himself by charging Jack with never being able to
2456  appreciate a compliment unless he were himself the subject, and so they
2457  drifted lightly from one bit of good-natured raillery to another. Now
2458  and then a more serious note was struck, and through it all the spirit
2459  of the party was more kindly and friendly than could be pictured by any
2460  words in which they might have tried to express it.
2461  
2462  When dinner was over, they went for a short stroll on the promenade. It
2463  naturally happened that Mrs. Fairhew walked with Taberman, and that Jack
2464  and Katrine strolled on together some little distance behind.
2465  
2466  "You don't know," said Jack, for the fourth or fifth time that evening,
2467  but with an evident sincerity which might have excused even further
2468  repetition, "how good it is to see you again."
2469  
2470  "Yes," Katrine responded with a carelessness too complete to be entirely
2471  genuine, "I suppose that it must be pleasant for you to see any one
2472  after being cooped up in a boat for five or six weeks."
2473  
2474  "That's not at all what I meant," he returned pointedly, and with a
2475  little vexation.
2476  
2477  "Perhaps not; but it's practically what you said."
2478  
2479  "I said it gave me pleasure to see you," Jack insisted, with a daring
2480  emphasis on the final pronoun.
2481  
2482  "Oh, a compliment!" she exclaimed, as if the thought had just struck
2483  her.
2484  
2485  "You may take it as such," he replied rather grumpily. "It's the
2486  feminine attitude toward everything."
2487  
2488  Katrine was silent a moment, examining with an appearance of the
2489  greatest interest the ground at her feet.
2490  
2491  "How queer you are this evening," she said at length.
2492  
2493  "Am I?" he retorted. "Well, I suppose if I'm only amusing into the
2494  bargain that's all that's necessary."
2495  
2496  Another brief interval of silence intervened, and then he remarked
2497  blunderingly:--
2498  
2499  "I suppose it makes very little difference to you whether you see any
2500  one while you're here."
2501  
2502  "What an atrocious reflection on my efforts to be entertaining," she
2503  laughed.
2504  
2505  "Oh," he said savagely, "that's a nice meaning to twist out of my words!
2506  You know I don't mean that."
2507  
2508  "You seem to have some difficulty in saying what you do mean this
2509  evening," Katrine commented mockingly.
2510  
2511  Jack laughed uneasily, with that absurdly tragic air possible only to a
2512  young man much in love.
2513  
2514  "See here," he asked explosively, "why do you think I came over here?"
2515  
2516  "I'm sure I can't say, Mr. Castleport," she replied, with a touch of
2517  coolness. "I never was good at riddles. Don't you think we had better
2518  catch up with Aunt Anne and Mr. Taberman?"
2519  
2520  And greatly to his own disgust, and perhaps, could he but have known the
2521  truth, to the secret disappointment of Katrine, Jack acted upon her
2522  suggestion without a word more.
2523  
2524  As they were taking leave of the ladies at the hotel a little later,
2525  Jerry broke out with a clumsily worded invitation that they should on
2526  the morrow go for a sail on the Merle.
2527  
2528  "You are really very good, Mr. Taberman," Mrs. Fairhew said, "but I 'm
2529  afraid it's only half an invitation, for Mr. Castleport doesn't second
2530  it."
2531  
2532  "I certainly do," Jack responded. "I was hesitating only because I
2533  didn't think the yacht, just in from an ocean voyage, was exactly in
2534  trim. I wasn't sure it was fair to invite you."
2535  
2536  "I think we can put up with anything that is amiss in that line," Mrs.
2537  Fairhew answered, smiling. "What do you say, Katrine? Would you like to
2538  go?"
2539  
2540  "Very much, Aunt Anne," her niece said, with a quick little glance at
2541  Jack, a sort of bird-twinkle of the eyes, "if we shall not be too
2542  intrusive."
2543  
2544  "Capital!" cried Jack, whose good nature had returned, and who was
2545  anxious to make amends for his fit of pique. "I'll call for you in the
2546  morning at about noon, if that will suit you. We shall want a little
2547  time to get the yacht in trim."
2548  
2549  "Any time after ten will do for us," Mrs. Fairhew answered. "Don't, I
2550  beg, bother too much about making things neat. I know how necessary
2551  disorder is to the real happiness of you men."

2558  Chapter Seven
2559  
2560  LUNCHEON ABOARD
2561  
2562  
2563  Noon.
2564  
2565  The famous promenade was deserted, and all the foreigners who were able
2566  were safe in the coolest retirement of their little pink and white
2567  villas. A warm off-shore breeze wandered through the silent streets of
2568  Nice, came to the water-front, and there, as if alarmed by the noise and
2569  bustle of the few sailors and fishermen whom the heat had not driven
2570  from the quays, grew brisker and fled away southward over the sea.
2571  
2572  Down one of the smaller streets between the Hôtel des Anglais and the
2573  Porta Vecchia, Mrs. Fairhew and her niece, escorted by Jack, were making
2574  their way. Miss Marchfield, dressed in a simple gown of white, looked
2575  deliciously rosy under her red sunshade. Mrs. Fairhew walked in the
2576  narrow strip of shadow next the wall; Katrine was between her and Jack,
2577  who, owing to the straitness of the sidewalk, picked his way--to the
2578  evident amusement of Miss Marchfield--along the kennel. As Katrine was
2579  fond of him, she paradoxically took unfailing delight in seeing him
2580  humiliated, always provided, of course, that no one other than herself
2581  was the author of the discomfort. The three were nearing the water-front
2582  when the elder lady broke a silence of some minutes' duration.
2583  
2584  "I hope the yacht is not very much farther, Mr. Castleport," she
2585  ventured.
2586  
2587  "No," Jack answered, "she's at the foot of the next street. 'Twas
2588  awfully stupid of me not to have got hold of a fiacre, but it seems so
2589  short a distance for me to walk that I didn't think."
2590  
2591  "I wonder why a yacht is always _she_ and _her_," observed Katrine. "Why
2592  not _it_?"
2593  
2594  "Oh, the reason's plain enough," was Jack's answer. "Yachts have two
2595  characteristics that are thoroughly feminine,--caprice and beauty."
2596  
2597  "It is good of you to temper the aspersion on my sex with a compliment,"
2598  Katrine returned.
2599  
2600  "It is obliging in me," Jack assented; "but politeness requires that I
2601  should stretch a point, since you are my guest."
2602  
2603  "I am sorry to put you to the inconvenience," she said.
2604  
2605  "Of being polite? Thank you!"
2606  
2607  "Do you know, I'm sorry that your uncle is not here, Mr. Castleport,"
2608  said Mrs. Fairhew, as they turned the corner. "It is all very well to
2609  have an old woman for a chaperon, but it is rather hard on you and Mr.
2610  Taberman not to have some older man to talk to me."
2611  
2612  "Oh, you mustn't depreciate your charm at the expense of your age," Jack
2613  cried.
2614  
2615  "Very pretty," laughed Mrs. Fairhew; "but your uncle"--
2616  
2617  "Ouch!" exclaimed Jack, making a fine show of stubbing the toe of his
2618  rubber-soled shoe against a projecting paving-stone.
2619  
2620  "What did you say?" inquired Katrine, with an air of mild interest.
2621  
2622  "Nothing. I stubbed my toe on that beastly stone," answered Jack, with a
2623  feeling of satisfaction that the President was once more shelved. "Now,"
2624  he added, "the boat is just here."
2625  
2626  A small but motley crowd was scattered along the water-front: bronzed
2627  fishermen, with close-cropped hair and long earrings, carrying osier
2628  baskets of shining sardines from their boats to their little carts; fat,
2629  raucous-voiced women, with red or yellow scarves pinned across their
2630  bosoms; lean-shanked 'longshoremen, too old for the sea this many a day;
2631  brown sailors, picking their way among the piles of iridescent
2632  fish,--liver-colored squid and flabby octopi; half-naked boys,
2633  outrageous and beautiful; with a miscellaneous sprinkling of human
2634  flotsam and jetsam, as if the sea had cast them up battered and damaged.
2635  Over all floated a distracting hubbub, made up of the rattling of
2636  cart-wheels on the flags, the shrill cries of the venders, the calls of
2637  the lads, the songs of the fishermen, and a medley of oaths, jests,
2638  curses, directions, questions, and all sorts of vociferous shoutings.
2639  
2640  Both the ladies drew closer to Jack, who, masterfully making his way
2641  through the press, piloted them across the quay. At the landing-steps
2642  they found Jerry and the Merle's cutter, the object of the staring
2643  curiosity and admiration of the wharf-rats and the loungers of the
2644  docks.
2645  
2646  "Good-morning, Mr. Taberman. Have we kept you waiting long?" asked Mrs.
2647  Fairhew.
2648  
2649  Tab had been broiling for half an hour, but was too courteous to say so.
2650  He responded cheerily, then helped the ladies aboard, and established
2651  them in the sheets. Jack took the tiller-lines, word was given, and the
2652  men fell to pulling. The breeze was fresher and cooler on the water; it
2653  made the ripples dance and glitter in the sunshine, and kept playfully
2654  curling the ensign at the stern of the cutter about Jack's head.
2655  According to previous instructions, the watch on the Merle got up anchor
2656  on seeing the cutter leave the quay, and were now holding the yacht in
2657  the wind's eye. When the boat came alongside, the ladies were handed
2658  aboard, the guest-salute was fired, the cutter was hoisted to the
2659  davits, and the yacht was paid off.
2660  
2661  They ran out past the old battery and the lighthouse on the outer mole,
2662  and coasted along to the westward. In the bright sunlight the numerous
2663  dwellings--villas, hotels, and _pensions_--showing among the green
2664  foliage of the trees looked very gay and attractive. The sea was dimpled
2665  with laughter. The breeze, although it gave promise of freshening, was
2666  now only strong enough to make the schooner, which was carrying all
2667  sail, heel gracefully as she slipped along. The day was perfect for
2668  light sailing.
2669  
2670  At one o'clock old Gonzague, his linen jacket dazzling in its whiteness
2671  and his snowy hair brushed back from his high forehead, served luncheon.
2672  Jack sat by Mrs. Fairhew on the starboard side, with Katrine and Jerry
2673  opposite. Gonzague had outdone himself for the occasion. A Provençal by
2674  birth, he knew the culinary value of all the wares--to foreign eyes so
2675  puzzlingly useless and hopelessly inedible--displayed in Mediterranean
2676  markets. The dishes which appeared on the table made Jack and Tab stare:
2677  fresh sardines broiled and served with some mysterious sauce of which
2678  they tried in vain to guess the ingredients; something which Katrine
2679  pronounced delicious until she discovered it to be cuttlefish, and then
2680  could not be prevailed upon to taste further; a salad which had lettuce
2681  as its obvious foundation, but which was fragrant with a dozen strange
2682  and piquant herbs; ripe citrons and limes; figs and bullaces; and a
2683  wonderful fruity sherbet for dessert.
2684  
2685  "Do you generally fare like this on board the Merle?" Mrs. Fairhew
2686  inquired. "If you do, I should like to come here to board while you are
2687  in harbor."
2688  
2689  "Not much," returned Jerry bluntly. "This is all Gonzague's gallantry to
2690  you ladies. As a rule he gives us only pork and beans."
2691  
2692  "Dear me," she commented. "That's pretty hard fare."
2693  
2694  "Do you really have to live on pork and beans on a cruise?" asked
2695  Katrine.
2696  
2697  "Jerry was only speaking figuratively," explained Jack, with a laugh.
2698  "Of course we do better than that. The only time we really suffered was
2699  in a bit of a shake-up we had on the way over. The second week out we
2700  had a blow, and had to live on hardtack and coffee for three days."
2701  
2702  "And Gonzague must have stood on his head to make the coffee, too," put
2703  in Tab.
2704  
2705  "Was it really so bad as that?" asked Katrine. "I mean," she explained
2706  as the others laughed, "did it really blow so hard he couldn't cook
2707  things?"
2708  
2709  "Well," responded Taberman, "for forty hours we had it so hard we jolly
2710  well thought we'd have to cut."
2711  
2712  "Cut?" queried Mrs. Fairhew.
2713  
2714  "Yes, the sticks, you know," Jack explained.
2715  
2716  From the expression on her face it was abundantly evident that the lady
2717  did not know, but she said nothing. She had but the most casual
2718  acquaintance with nautical affairs, and made no pretense of
2719  understanding the speech of mariners; and she was always willing to let
2720  a matter of this sort go, rather than to submit to a lengthy exposition.
2721  
2722  Katrine, on the other hand, while of course not proficient in the art of
2723  handling yachts, knew enough to appreciate that when cutting away the
2724  masts had been contemplated, things must have been at a pass really
2725  dangerous. Now she made no comment, but she gave a swift glance at
2726  Jack, that had in it much of the admiration which Desdemona felt at the
2727  recital of the perils through which Othello had borne himself bravely.
2728  Jack happened to catch her eye; she flushed and turned to Jerry.
2729  
2730  "Don't you tire of it all?" she asked. "I should think that to have the
2731  monotony broken only by danger in which you can't have any rest or
2732  comfort would be dreadfully wearisome."
2733  
2734  "Oh, it's great sport!" cried Tab heartily. "Besides, you know, there
2735  are no end of things to do."
2736  
2737  "Such as what?" inquired Mrs. Fairhew. "I've always found the ocean
2738  voyage the most boresome thing about traveling, although I'm a perfectly
2739  good sailor."
2740  
2741  "Oh," said Jerry, with a flourish of his cigarette,--for coffee had been
2742  served and the ladies had permitted smoking,--"there are rope-ends to be
2743  attended to, and gear changed, and all that sort of thing, besides
2744  seeing that the men go over the brasswork properly every day; and there
2745  is taking sights, and making reckonings, and all sorts of things."
2746  
2747  "But I thought the men did all the work on the ropes and things."
2748  
2749  "So they do," Jack said, with a smile; "but it is our business to tell
2750  them what to do and to see that they do it. You must remember that we
2751  are the ship's officers."
2752  
2753  "We have to look things over all the time," Jerry added. "Just before we
2754  went ashore to-day I saw a thing that'll have to be attended to as soon
2755  as we get back at anchor. The fore-peak halyards are 'most chafed
2756  through where they reeve through the block on the cap."
2757  
2758  "Dear me!" said Mrs. Fairhew. "Is it dangerous?"
2759  
2760  "Not in the least dangerous," Jack returned reassuringly. "Is it really
2761  bad, Tab?"
2762  
2763  "Oh, well, I fancy it'll hold; leastways if there's no sudden strain on
2764  it. The rope's new enough; but it jammed there the other day, you
2765  remember."
2766  
2767  "Well, let's go on deck," suggested the captain. "It's such a gorgeous
2768  day, it's a shame to miss any of it."
2769  
2770  On coming up they found that the wind had so freshened that the
2771  fore-topsail and staysail had been struck, as well as the outer jib.
2772  
2773  "We can run on till about four o'clock," Castleport said, "and have
2774  plenty of time to run back with this wind."
2775  
2776  They still held to the westward, keeping about a mile off shore, now
2777  and then passing fishing craft, headed for Nice, their big lateen sails
2778  shining in the sunlight. Jack, watching Katrine keenly, read her delight
2779  and enjoyment in her eyes, and could see how she responded to the beauty
2780  of the day, the picturesqueness of the shore, the exhilaration of the
2781  wind, and the sparkling sea. At eight bells they had tea _au Russe_ on
2782  deck, and before they had finished drinking it the Merle was put about
2783  and headed for the harbor.
2784  
2785  They had hardly gone a knot before they fell in with a large black yawl
2786  flying the English colors and the burgee of the Royal Yacht Squadron.
2787  She was sailing easily along under all lower canvas, her black hull
2788  lifting gracefully over the sloping seas at about two cable-lengths
2789  ahead. She was in cruising rig, with no boom to her mainsail, yet was so
2790  large that her spread of canvas was at half a glance much greater than
2791  that of the Merle. She crossed the schooner's bows, and then, luffing
2792  occasionally, waited until the American yacht was on her beam.
2793  
2794  "Looks's though she wanted something of us," remarked Jerry. "Will you
2795  take another look at her, Miss Marchfield?" And he handed her the
2796  glasses.
2797  
2798  "She is a beauty!" exclaimed Katrine, regarding the yawl through the
2799  binoculars. "I can see her name now. I-s-i-s Isis, of--of Plymouth.
2800  Don't you want to look at her, Aunt Anne?"
2801  
2802  Mrs. Fairhew took the glasses with the air of a person doing a favor,
2803  and stared at the yawl in a perfunctory manner.
2804  
2805  "What an absurd bobtail of a sail that is set 'way back," she observed.
2806  "It looks quite like a deformity."
2807  
2808  "That's for balance in heavy weather," said Jerry, with gusto. "Hadn't
2809  we better salute, Jack?"
2810  
2811  "I suppose so," was the answer. "See; he's fallen off. Means to give us
2812  a run for it, I fancy."
2813  
2814  The Merle dipped her ensign, and the Englishman returned the salute in
2815  kind.
2816  
2817  "I say," cried Jerry, "they're setting their topsail. They want a race
2818  in earnest."
2819  
2820  "They've an able boat, to carry all sail when it's breezed up like
2821  this," commented Jack, giving the black yawl a critical look.
2822  
2823  "Come!" urged Tab. "Let's take a brace and give 'em a run for their
2824  money. We can beat 'em all right enough, both sides of the Atlantic."
2825  
2826  Jack looked first at Katrine and then at her aunt.
2827  
2828  "Would you mind?" he asked.
2829  
2830  "Mind?" cried Mrs. Fairhew, "I shouldn't mind it the least in the
2831  world--especially if we beat them."
2832  
2833  "All right," shouted Tab, leaping boyishly out of his wicker chair.
2834  "We'll show 'em! Watch along!" he roared to the crew.
2835  
2836  "Sway up on the main-peak halyards there," sang out Jack, who had also
2837  started up quickly. "That's good! Fore-peak now--that'll do! Set
2838  fore-topsail there--haul away! Good enough! All hands up to windward!"
2839  Then he turned to the helmsman. "I'll take her," he said. "You get up to
2840  windward with the rest."
2841  
2842  The man handed the helm over to him, and the race began.
2843  
2844  The yawl was on the windward beam, and both she and the schooner were
2845  carrying so much sail as now and again to be heeled lee rail under. At
2846  the end of twenty minutes the American boat seemed to be drawing ahead,
2847  although the Englishman, his red flag blowing out from his maintop, was
2848  still to windward.
2849  
2850  Katrine and her aunt had abandoned their chairs for the weather transom
2851  of the cockpit. Katrine was thoroughly alive to the excitement of this
2852  impromptu contest, while Mrs. Fairhew's well-bred face wore a smile
2853  which might be taken to signify either her superiority to such a
2854  youthful means of enjoyment or confidence in the power of the Merle to
2855  outstrip her rival.
2856  
2857  Jack, his strong, shapely hands grasping the spokes of the wheel,
2858  glanced only from the sails aloft to the yawl and back again. Katrine
2859  watched him furtively. His keen, eager pose, wholly free from
2860  self-consciousness and suggestive of power and vigilant activity, his
2861  masterful management of his craft,--she noted them all, and felt a
2862  certain pleasure in them, as if in some way she were responsible for
2863  them.
2864  
2865  "Think we'll come 'round, Jerrold," said the captain.
2866  
2867  He gave a rapid succession of orders as he twirled the spokes to port.
2868  The Merle came about on the other tack, the men got to stations on the
2869  weather side, and the ladies changed their places.
2870  
2871  "Now we'll see how much we've gained on them," said Jerry, half to the
2872  guests and half to himself.
2873  
2874  They drove toward the shore in the roughening sea, the port runway being
2875  now covered with a thin sheet of hissing green water. Up forward an
2876  occasional wave would come slap against the yacht's shoulder with a
2877  sound like a rifle-shot. The Isis crossed their bows at a distance so
2878  little ahead of them that her name and hail could be read easily
2879  without the aid of a glass.
2880  
2881  "We're outfooting them, Jack. We'll have 'em cold in twenty minutes!"
2882  cried Tab enthusiastically.
2883  
2884  "Don't count your chickens before they're hatched," laughed Katrine.
2885  
2886  "Oh, but we can't help doing 'em," he responded. "We'll have 'em so
2887  walloped that they'll go into dry-dock for a month."
2888  
2889  "You'd better rap on wood, Mr. Taberman," cautioned Mrs. Fairhew, with a
2890  smile. "I don't wish to be a croaking raven, but surely they're ahead
2891  now."
2892  
2893  Mrs. Fairhew had, as the race went on, grown more and more alert. Her
2894  eyes had in them the spark of a genuine lover of sport, and all the
2895  womanly love of contest and conquest showed in the eagerness of her pose
2896  and air.
2897  
2898  "Of course they're ahead," Jerry answered; "but we have the wind of them
2899  by a good deal."
2900  
2901  "I hope that means something," the lady commented, with a movement of
2902  the head half eager, half humorous, "but I confess that it is all Greek
2903  to me."
2904  
2905  Jerry began to explain, but before he could make things clear to the
2906  lady's unnautical mind, the yacht came about again to the port tack.
2907  The Merle was then so far to weather of the yawl that Jack ordered the
2908  sheets to be started a trifle.
2909  
2910  "Now then, Jerry, here's where we overhaul them," Jack cried exultingly.
2911  "Just set the balloon-jib outside the headsails. I think she'll stand
2912  it."
2913  
2914  "Want the staysail?" asked the mate.
2915  
2916  "No--'twould spoil her helm," returned the captain. "Jump along, old
2917  man."
2918  
2919  The change was effected as quickly as might be, and the yacht's speed
2920  was visibly increased.
2921  
2922  "That yawl's better on the wind than off," the captain commented. "We're
2923  picking up on 'em now like smoke."
2924  
2925  After an hour's chase and half an hour's jockeying off the mouth of the
2926  port, the Merle was about to run in when the English yacht luffed up and
2927  crossed the schooner's bows. Both boats were close-hauled, but the
2928  American was on the starboard tack and had the right of way. The
2929  helmsman of the Isis gave Jack his choice of running the yawl down or
2930  luffing himself. Jack chose the latter alternative; although naturally
2931  angry at such an unsportsmanlike trick, he could not take risks with his
2932  uncle's yacht, least of all with the ladies on board. The Englishman did
2933  not spare him, but first blanketed him, and then, putting his helm up
2934  and leaving the Merle with a small ledge frothing to leeward, forced the
2935  schooner about. Under his tan Jack grew white with indignant anger. He
2936  was not the man to lose his temper in his pastimes, but he had a strong
2937  sense of justice, a thorough contempt for trickery, and he was quick to
2938  resent a deliberate outrage of this sort. The performance was so
2939  evidently premeditated on the part of the Isis that it amounted to a
2940  most flagrant insult, a cold-blooded piece of sporting caddishness. The
2941  only remedy possible under the circumstances was a desperate one, but in
2942  his state of mind he did not hesitate.
2943  
2944  "Stand by to jibe!" he roared. "Cast off the topsail halyards! Now aft
2945  on the sheets!"
2946  
2947  It was blowing too hard for jibing with safety even under reduced cloth,
2948  and barring staysail and topsails, the Merle was under full canvas.
2949  
2950  "My God!" exclaimed Jerry to the winds, as he tumbled aft to help on the
2951  sheet, "he'll pull the sticks out of her! Something's bound to go!"
2952  
2953  Jack held the wheel hard up, and the schooner swung steadily off. The
2954  booms rushed over the decks, fetched up with a crash, and then swung out
2955  as the men payed off the sheets. The lee rail went clean under, and for
2956  a second or two unpleasant and portentous creakings and groanings
2957  filled the air. The men flew about with wonderful dexterity, while the
2958  two ladies held on to each other to avoid being pitched headlong.
2959  
2960  "Are any of your teeth shaken out, Katrine?" Mrs. Fairhew inquired, when
2961  they were able once more to sit up. "All mine were loosened by that
2962  awful jerk."
2963  
2964  "They are all safe, Aunt Anne," Katrine cried, her voice vibrant with
2965  delighted excitement. "Isn't it splendid?"
2966  
2967  Her hair was blowing about her face, her eyes were shining, her cheeks
2968  were flushed; and Jack, though his swift glance merely caught a view of
2969  her as it flashed up to the sails, carried the alluring picture in his
2970  mind for many a day. The thought of it was for the time being instantly
2971  crowded out of his mind as he caught sight of the rigging. As the Merle
2972  had leaped ahead, the fore-peak halyards, which had not been started
2973  before the yacht was jibed, had parted. The gaff hung nearly at right
2974  angles to the boom, and the sail was being strained out of shape. The
2975  captain was so upset that in his rage he was guilty of swearing before
2976  ladies.
2977  
2978  "What shall we do?" sang out Jerry.
2979  
2980  Jack's cry had called his attention to the mishap, and he had run
2981  forward.
2982  
2983  "Really this grows exciting," remarked Mrs. Fairhew, as if she were at
2984  the theatre.
2985  
2986  "Oh, what a shame! what a shame!" wailed Katrine, looking despairingly
2987  up at the drooping gaff.
2988  
2989  "Get some half-inch on it!" shouted Jack, almost beside himself at
2990  having been bullied into this predicament. "Take it out as far as you
2991  can! Reeve it through the cap-block first. Move along there! Smartly!"
2992  
2993  "All right!" cried Tab; and in the same moment, with a coil of new rope
2994  over his shoulder, and followed by one of the men, he ran up the weather
2995  rigging.
2996  
2997  On reaching the cross-trees, Tab passed the end of his rope through the
2998  block on the masthead cap and fastened it to his belt. Then he swung
2999  himself down to the jaws of the gaff and lay out along the spar. The big
3000  stick threshed about wildly, threatening to snap him into the sea at
3001  every fling. Slowly and painfully he worked his way out. He clung on
3002  desperately, so that it seemed like a conscious fight between himself
3003  and the plunging spar whether he should be shaken off. It was like a
3004  man's trying to tame a bucking horse, only a hundred times more
3005  exciting, and Katrine grew pale as she watched, while even Mrs. Fairhew
3006  set her lips closely. The three minutes it took Jerry to reach the
3007  peak-halyard block seemed to every person on the Merle all but
3008  interminable. Twice he nearly fell,--once at the outset when he slipped,
3009  and again when he had to crawl around the throat halyards between rolls.
3010  The second time he was actually thrown off the spar, but fortunately he
3011  held his grip on the halyards. The next lurch of the yacht playfully
3012  tossed him into the air, and he was lucky enough to regain his position
3013  on the spar.
3014  
3015  Getting to the peak-block, he unknotted the rope from his belt, passed
3016  it about the spar, and took a "timber-hitch." He then slowly worked his
3017  way back, and eventually reached the cross-trees in safety. The nervous
3018  tension had been so strong that when the men saw him coming down the
3019  ratlines they fell to cheering lustily, Gonzague, his white hair ruffled
3020  by the wind, waving his arms and out-shouting the whole of them. They
3021  speedily got hold of the jury halyard, and even before Jerry had reached
3022  the deck, the gaff was again well raised, and the topsail set.
3023  
3024  In the mean time the Isis had in her turn got into difficulties. It is
3025  poor business jockeying among reefs, and the yawl had been forced to
3026  come about, luff up, and drift sternwards until her chances of beating
3027  the Merle were utterly gone. The fact seemed to be that the English
3028  captain had counted upon the Merle's not daring to jibe, and so had been
3029  too clever by half.
3030  
3031  Jerry came aft, very red in the face, and with the customary twinkle in
3032  his eye. The ladies were evidently greatly impressed by his feat, and
3033  Jack, who of course understood more clearly than they how dangerous the
3034  task had been, took one hand off the wheel and wrung Jerry's.
3035  
3036  "Awfully sorry, old man," he said. "But I was so hot at that Englishman
3037  I lost my head for a minute."
3038  
3039  "Oh, go 'long!" returned Jerry, grinning. "Don't you suppose I was hot
3040  myself?"
3041  
3042  He dropped on to a seat beside Mrs. Fairhew, to recover his breath.
3043  
3044  "Mr. Taberman," said that lady, "I'm an old woman,"--it was one of Mrs.
3045  Fairhew's idiosyncrasies to call attention thus whimsically to the fact
3046  that she looked hardly more than thirty,--"I'm an old woman, and
3047  consequently I disapprove of rashness; but I don't mind saying that I
3048  like your pluck."
3049  
3050  She looked at him in a curious way, as if he were an amusing case of
3051  arrested development, but her glance was full of kindliness.
3052  
3053  "Thank you," Tab answered, with a smile which was too confused not to
3054  be almost a grin. "It's more a sound wind than pluck, I assure you."
3055  
3056  "It was perfectly magnificent!" Katrine cried. "You're a perfect hero!"
3057  
3058  They all laughed, more perhaps from the nervous reaction after the
3059  strain than from any especial amusement, and Jerry blushed more than
3060  ever.
3061  
3062  "I'm afraid you're inclined to make a mountain out of a molehill," he
3063  said. "We don't allow heroics aboard here, you know. Jack did the
3064  only"--
3065  
3066  "That'll do, Jerry," called Jack from the wheel.
3067  
3068  "All right, captain," Tab returned, laughing. "Under orders."
3069  
3070  "Oh, but that's not fair," cried Katrine. "If Mr. Castleport played the
3071  hero too, we want to know all about it."
3072  
3073  "I'll masthead that mate if he goes on talking about his superior
3074  officer," Jack threatened. "See, the Isis has given the whole thing up."
3075  
3076  "She'd better," commented Jerry, "though I don't see that she had
3077  anything left to give."
3078  
3079  The yawl was well astern now. Her sailing-master had for a little time,
3080  in a vain endeavor to overtake his rival, pinched his boat unmercifully,
3081  so that with her nose in the wind's eye her sails were every now and
3082  then a-shiver. Now she had evidently accepted the inevitable, and was
3083  making quietly for an anchorage.
3084  
3085  "Tell us about Mr. Castleport," Katrine said to Jerry in an undertone.
3086  
3087  "Oh," returned Tab, "he stuck to the wheel over forty-eight hours when
3088  we had that blow we were talking about. It was a magnificent thing to
3089  do, and I think he saved us from everlasting smash. Of course he
3090  pooh-poohs the idea, but Jack's never willing to have anybody say he's
3091  done anything big. He's as modest as he is stunning," he ended warmly,
3092  throwing at the captain a glance of admiration and affection.
3093  
3094  Katrine made no audible comment, but her glance followed his, and had
3095  Jack intercepted her look at that moment, he might have felt his heart
3096  beat more briskly.
3097  
3098  The superior speed of the Merle, aided by the poor tactics of the
3099  skipper of the Isis, who seemed to lose his head when he found he was
3100  beaten, gave the American so much the lead that the schooner had dropped
3101  her anchor a minute or two before the yawl rounded the inner mole.
3102  
3103  "I never had so splendid a sail in my life," Katrine said.
3104  
3105  "I was sure you would beat that other boat, Mr. Castleport," Mrs.
3106  Fairhew told him, "and I confess I enjoyed seeing you do it."
3107  
3108  "I couldn't be so rude as to let you ladies be beaten in a race," the
3109  captain responded, laughing.
3110  
3111  "Of course not," put in Jerry; "no gentleman would let a lady be
3112  beaten."
3113  
3114  "What an atrocious pun!" cried Katrine; "and Mr. Taberman looks actually
3115  wistful for fear we shouldn't see it."
3116  
3117  "Well," her aunt said, moving toward the ladder, where the cutter was in
3118  waiting, "it has been a delightful day, and we are greatly obliged."
3119  
3120  While the ladies were being pulled ashore, and before Jack and Jerry had
3121  returned, everything on the Merle was put in order. Just as they went
3122  below to dress for going ashore for dinner, a boat from the yawl came
3123  alongside with a note for the "Captain of the Merle; sch. Y't." Gonzague
3124  brought it to Castleport, who looked at it, and then read it aloud to
3125  Jerry.
3126  
3127  
3128       YAWL YACHT ISIS. Y. S.
3129  
3130       Lord Merryfield presents his compliments to the gentleman who
3131       handled the Merle in such a masterly fashion this afternoon, and
3132       requests the honor of his presence at dinner on board the Isis this
3133       evening at six bells, A. T. It will be an additional pleasure to
3134       Lord Merryfield if the gentleman who so pluckily rose to the
3135       occasion in the matter of a parted halyard will accompany the
3136       captain of the Merle.
3137  
3138       R. S. V. P.
3139  
3140       NICE, July 17, 1902.
3141  
3142  
3143  "Rot!" said Jerry inelegantly. "Let me answer it."
3144  
3145  "Get out!" responded Jack. "I think I can settle him."
3146  
3147  He got out the President's most elaborate stationery, and after some
3148  meditation and the destruction of one or two epistles which would not go
3149  quite to suit him, he handed to Jerry the following:--
3150  
3151  
3152       SCH. YT. MERLE, E. Y. C.
3153  
3154       Captain John Castleport and Mr. Jerrold Taberman present their
3155       compliments to Lord Merryfield and regret that, owing to a previous
3156       engagement, it is impossible for them to accept the invitation so
3157       kindly tendered to them. Captain Castleport further desires
3158       earnestly to express his opinion in regard to having been forced
3159       about by the Y. Yt. Isis this afternoon when he had the right of
3160       way; and to say that he considers such a manoeuvre so
3161       unsportsmanlike and insulting that it should be impossible in a
3162       gentleman's race. As the injured party, he ventures to remind Lord
3163       Merryfield that the only reparation that can be made is the
3164       severest reprimanding of the sailing-master, or whoever was
3165       responsible for this inexcusable expedient.
3166  
3167       NICE, July 17, 1902.
3168  
3169  
3170  "You see," Jack explained, "we let him know what we think of that
3171  caddish trick without being in the least rude ourselves. Of course the
3172  chances are that he was responsible for the thing himself, and there we
3173  have him on the hip."
3174  
3175  "I suppose it's all right," grumbled Jerry. "You know best; but if I 'd
3176  written it, I should have told him straight out that I thought him a
3177  damned cad!"

3184  Chapter Eight
3185  
3186  A CHANGE OF TACTICS
3187  
3188  
3189  As they sat that evening in the garden of the hotel drinking their
3190  after-dinner coffee, which the gentlemen accompanied with cigarettes,
3191  they discussed the news from home contained in a batch of letters Mrs.
3192  Fairhew and her niece had found awaiting them on their return from the
3193  yacht. The announcement of an engagement, rumors of flirtations which
3194  might end in others, the latest gossip about people they all knew, were
3195  mingled with chat about an extraordinary yacht race at Northeast Harbor,
3196  a Russian princess at Nahant, an automobile accident at Lenox, and a
3197  fresh divorce at Newport.
3198  
3199  "Everything else," Mrs. Fairhew said at length, "is simply nothing at
3200  all in comparison to a piece of business news I received. Have you heard
3201  of the Tillington failure?"
3202  
3203  "What!" cried Jack. "R. B. Tillington?"
3204  
3205  "Yes. Their own notice was with the other mail this afternoon," she
3206  responded. "Liabilities something like a third of a million and their
3207  assets nothing."
3208  
3209  "How in the world did it happen?" asked Tab. "I knew they had a lot to
3210  do with mines, and of course those are always risky; but Tillington
3211  always had the name of being awfully clever."
3212  
3213  "Perhaps he was too clever," Jack suggested.
3214  
3215  "Clever or not," Mrs. Fairhew said, "he has come to grief, and, I am
3216  ashamed to confess, he has lost some money for me."
3217  
3218  "I am very sorry for that," Jack responded. "I'll wager you'll have
3219  plenty of distinguished company. I'm awfully afraid Uncle Randolph got
3220  his fingers burned. He's had dealings with Tillington for ever so long.
3221  I never took kindly to the man myself, but Uncle Randolph had a great
3222  opinion of his business sagacity."
3223  
3224  "I'll wager Mrs. Fairhew's bound to be in good company even in
3225  misfortune," Jerry declared with his usual somewhat clumsy gallantry.
3226  
3227  Mrs. Fairhew smiled, and made a little sweeping gesture with her fan as
3228  if the subject were a disagreeable one and should be waved aside.
3229  
3230  "Even that," she said, "doesn't soothe my wounded vanity. The money I've
3231  lost is fortunately not very much, but I pride myself on my business
3232  head, and I made this investment in spite of the advice of my banker.
3233  Think how he will chuckle! I'd rather have lost three times as much on
3234  an investment he selected."
3235  
3236  "How thoroughly feminine!" Jack laughed.
3237  
3238  "Of course you can't understand," Katrine struck in. "I agree with Aunt
3239  Anne entirely. Of course one would rather lose money than to give a man
3240  a chance to crow over her."
3241  
3242  The talk was thus drawn into the inexhaustible discussion of feminine
3243  and masculine characteristics, that topic about which revolves two
3244  thirds of all the small talk of the world. Then it drifted back to the
3245  personal news of the letters.
3246  
3247  "I don't think Billy Rafton's to be congratulated," announced Tab
3248  emphatically, in reference to a recent wedding. "Edna Leighton has
3249  plenty of money of course, and is a stunning girl and all that; but
3250  she's so horribly ambitious that she won't give poor Billy a minute's
3251  peace."
3252  
3253  "And Billy is one of the most quiet men alive," put in Jack.
3254  
3255  "Ambitious?" queried Katrine. "How? I've known her pretty well, and to
3256  me she always seemed nice. Certainly she's clever."
3257  
3258  "So she is clever," Jerry assented; "but of course that'll make it
3259  harder for Billy to stand out against her."
3260  
3261  "She naturally would have the instinct to get ahead in the world,"
3262  commented Castleport. "Her mother was a Farquhar."
3263  
3264  "Mr. Castleport," remonstrated Mrs. Fairhew, "that remark is too
3265  feminine to be worthy of you."
3266  
3267  "Do you regret that I didn't leave it for you to say?" he asked saucily.
3268  "I know you entirely agree with me."
3269  
3270  "Her father, Stephen Leighton," Mrs. Fairhew continued, making no answer
3271  but a hardly perceptible smile to his statement, "was a thoroughly
3272  charming man and of very good family. You can't deny that, Mr.
3273  Castleport."
3274  
3275  "I haven't any wish to. I'm not trying to run down Edna
3276  Leighton--Rafton, that is."
3277  
3278  "I always thought," began Katrine. Then she stopped, with an involuntary
3279  movement of the eyes in the direction of Taberman.
3280  
3281  "Oh, I was hit there once," Tab said jovially, "if that's what you mean.
3282  I got over it at a boat race."
3283  
3284  They all laughed, and the topic seemed exhausted, when the elder lady
3285  said:--
3286  
3287  "We shall have sight of them at Florence, I suppose. They are to be at
3288  the Villa Foscagni for the summer. It belongs to the Raftons."
3289  
3290  "When do you expect to get there?" Tab inquired carelessly.
3291  
3292  "Florence? In five or six days."
3293  
3294  "Five or six days!" cried Jack. "Why, when do you leave here?"
3295  
3296  "To-morrow afternoon," answered Katrine in a tone of which the
3297  indifference might have struck Jack as a little overdone had he not been
3298  too perturbed to notice.
3299  
3300  "Why--but--" Jack began; "I had no idea"--
3301  
3302  "Did you fancy we were here for the summer?" queried Katrine with demure
3303  interest.
3304  
3305  The hint of teasing in her tone brought Castleport to himself. Half his
3306  social success lay in the fact that he was not easily disconcerted.
3307  
3308  "As Mrs. Fairhew was good enough to tell me her plans," he returned
3309  coolly, "I naturally understood that you were to leave here before long,
3310  but I admit I hadn't thought you would go so soon."
3311  
3312  "You see," Mrs. Fairhew explained, "we really must get on. Katrine has
3313  to do museums and things, as I told you. When I was a girl it wouldn't
3314  have been thought respectable for a girl to come out before she'd seen
3315  the Pitti and Uffizzi; but it's all different now."
3316  
3317  "What nonsense, Aunt Anne! I don't believe you'd seen the galleries
3318  yourself when you came out."
3319  
3320  "Indeed I had. I'll make you read all the finest print in the
3321  guide-books if you are impertinent. We take," she added, turning to
3322  Castleport, "the 3.08 for Genoa."
3323  
3324  Jack was by nature quick and resolute; and before Mrs. Fairhew had got
3325  to this remark he had conceived a plan, and resolved to follow it out.
3326  Gravely regarding the thicket of oleanders behind Miss Marchfield, yet
3327  with the tail of his eye on the face of Jerry, which was alternately
3328  lighted and obscured as his cigarette glowed or waned, the captain
3329  remarked coolly:--
3330  
3331  "That's a curious coincidence."
3332  
3333  "Coincidence?" repeated Mrs. Fairhew questioningly.
3334  
3335  "It would seem so," Jack almost drawled. "You said the 3.08, didn't you?
3336  How far do you go? All the way to Genoa?"
3337  
3338  "Yes. What is there extraordinary about that?"
3339  
3340  "Why, nothing much," returned Jack in a brisker tone, throwing away the
3341  butt of his cigarette; "only--yes--that's the very train I go on
3342  myself. Same destination, too, unless I decide to stop at Bordighera."
3343  
3344  There naturally was a sensation at this unexpected announcement. Katrine
3345  drew in her breath audibly; in the very nick of time Jerry caught
3346  himself in the act of saying profanely what he would be; Mrs. Fairhew
3347  closed her fan quickly, but she was too much mistress of herself to give
3348  any indication of her feelings beyond a little quick laugh.
3349  
3350  "I had not remembered that you spoke of going," she said.
3351  
3352  "No?" Jack said politely.
3353  
3354  "But," gasped Jerry, "I say--you know, I say"--
3355  
3356  Evidently his feelings were too much for him, and he collapsed. So
3357  sudden a move on the part of Jack was sure to disconcert his
3358  slower-witted comrade, and the captain had fortunately been prepared by
3359  previous experiences for some mental confusion on the part of the mate.
3360  
3361  "Yes, Jerry?" he asked.
3362  
3363  "Nothing--I--I don't remember what I was going to say," murmured the
3364  bewildered Tab.
3365  
3366  "Really," observed Mrs. Fairhew, "it hadn't occurred to me that you
3367  could or would leave the yacht. What becomes of her?"
3368  
3369  "Oh, you don't doubt Jerry, do you? He's going to take her in charge."
3370  
3371  Once determined upon his plan, Jack felt it best to carry matters off
3372  with a high hand. He did not in the least care whether Mrs. Fairhew and
3373  Katrine suspected that his resolution to go on by land had been taken on
3374  the spot or not; but he liked to play the game well, and to put a good
3375  face on things. He spoke as though his mind had been made up long
3376  before, although all the time his brain was working with furious energy,
3377  as he tried to shape the scheme thoroughly and to foresee all possible
3378  contingencies. To give over to Jerry the care of the President's yacht
3379  was a bold stroke, but he said to himself that he was confident his
3380  friend was entirely competent to manage her for the comparatively short
3381  run to Naples; and his thought nimbly disposed of objection after
3382  objection as they rose in his mind.
3383  
3384  Rapid as had been his decision, it was less wild than it might seem; and
3385  by the time he spoke again Jack had all the details pretty well
3386  mastered.
3387  
3388  "Do you leave the Merle here?" inquired Mrs. Fairhew.
3389  
3390  Katrine, Jack noted, had said nothing, but he had heard that quick,
3391  indrawn breath, and he did not believe that her silence arose from
3392  indifference.
3393  
3394  "Oh, no; Jerry's going to take her to Naples," was Castleport's cool
3395  reply.
3396  
3397  It was to Tab's credit that at this astounding piece of intelligence he
3398  did not make a violent demonstration; but he was not unaccustomed to the
3399  rapidity with which Jack came to a decision, and he had before been
3400  trained in accepting what his captain said. Now he only dropped his
3401  cigarette, and on picking it up put the lighted end between his lips,
3402  spluttered and smothered a profane comment, and hurled the offending
3403  butt as far as he could.
3404  
3405  "Have another?" asked Jack, unruffled, as he pushed his case across the
3406  little table by which they were sitting.
3407  
3408  "Thank you, no!" replied Tab with quite unnecessary emphasis.
3409  
3410  "You've no need to touch your lips with fire, Mr. Taberman," Mrs.
3411  Fairhew observed, opening and closing her fan in a way which she had
3412  when amused; "you have been sufficiently eloquent in compliments ever
3413  since you arrived. May we hope, then," she went on, turning to
3414  Castleport, "for the pleasure of your company on the journey?"
3415  
3416  "If you and Miss Marchfield do not object, I shall be delighted."
3417  
3418  "It will be a great pleasure to me. Of course I can't speak for
3419  Katrine."
3420  
3421  Jack turned to look at Katrine. On her face the soft light of a Japanese
3422  lantern fell between a couple of trees, but she at once moved so that
3423  the shadows hid her expression.
3424  
3425  "Nothing could please me more, Aunt Anne, than that you should be
3426  pleased," she responded.
3427  
3428  "Then you had better bring Mr. Taberman and your luggage ashore, and
3429  come to luncheon to-morrow," the aunt said, rising. "In that way we can
3430  take our time and be comfortable. Does that suit your plans, Mr.
3431  Castleport?"
3432  
3433  Jack detected the suspicion of mirth in her voice, but he felt that if
3434  she had disapproved she would not only have shown no amusement but that
3435  she was clever enough to have thwarted his scheme.
3436  
3437  "I don't want to abuse your hospitality," he said.
3438  
3439  "Oh, we shall make you useful as an escort, and get enough service out
3440  of you on the journey to pay that," spoke Katrine, with the air of
3441  feeling that she had been too noticeably silent.
3442  
3443  "We're only too delighted to come, of course," Jerry said with boyish
3444  enthusiasm. "Anybody'd be glad of a chance to lunch with you, Mrs.
3445  Fairhew."
3446  
3447  "Your compliments are rather direct, Mr. Taberman," that lady answered
3448  with a laugh. "We'll say 1.30, then. That will give us plenty of time. I
3449  hate to be hurried; it is so undignified."
3450  
3451  As Mrs. Fairhew had risen the others were of course on their feet, and
3452  as Jack stood aside for Katrine to pass him, the elder lady took his
3453  arm. By this she detained him an instant, until her niece and Jerry were
3454  a few yards away. When they approached the door of the hotel and it was
3455  light enough for him to see her clearly, she dropped his arm; and as he
3456  turned his face toward her at the movement, she regarded him through her
3457  lorgnette with a look quizzical though kindly.
3458  
3459  "You are a clever boy," she said after a little, and with a peculiar
3460  faint stress on the adjective. "Do you want to marry my niece?"
3461  
3462  Jack of course recognized that the question would never have been asked
3463  had there been any doubt of the answer, and even in the confusion of the
3464  moment he had a dim perception that Mrs. Fairhew was, with kindly whim,
3465  helping him to ask her sanction to his wooing. He felt his cheeks grow
3466  hot, but he faced his inquisitor frankly, and he spoke with a manner
3467  which though instinctively subdued was full of energy and feeling.
3468  
3469  "You know I do," he said. "You know I'd die the worst of deaths for
3470  her. I--As God's above me," he burst out, breaking off and feeling
3471  himself strangle with his emotion, "I'll win her or die trying! I--I--
3472  Of course I want to marry her! What do you suppose I came to Europe
3473  for?"
3474  
3475  Mrs. Fairhew's face softened, for no true woman could have heard the
3476  passion of his voice unmoved; but she laughed at the sudden change with
3477  which he ended.
3478  
3479  "I hope you may succeed," she said softly. "I think you will." Then she
3480  took his arm again, and spoke in her ordinary voice: "Come, we must go
3481  in."
3482  
3483  
3484  "Now, then, Jack, in the name of heaven," demanded Jerry, as soon as he
3485  and the captain were out of hearing of the ladies, "what is this awful
3486  josh of yours about leaving the yacht?"
3487  
3488  "I'll tell you when we get aboard," his friend answered. "Don't bother
3489  me now; I'm thinking."
3490  
3491  Tab snorted contemptuously, and in silence the pair held on until they
3492  reached the quay. The cutter awaited them, and still in silence they
3493  were pulled out to the Merle. There was not a breath of wind now; the
3494  stars blazed brilliantly above them, and not a cloud-blot was to be
3495  seen. In a stillness broken only by the rhythmical oar-strokes the pair
3496  watched the myriad star-points which dotted the heavens as they had
3497  adorned it centuries before when old Nice was new Nicæa, and some brown
3498  Sicilian pilot may have gazed up at them and made haven by their
3499  faithful guidance.
3500  
3501  No sooner were they aboard than Gonzague came to ask if they would have
3502  supper.
3503  
3504  "Oh, I don't know," Jack answered, still in a dream from the spell of
3505  Mrs. Fairhew's words.
3506  
3507  "Well, I do," put in Jerry. "We'll have some caviare sandwiches,
3508  Gonzague, and a glass of sherry."
3509  
3510  The supper was eaten almost in silence, and it was not until Gonzague
3511  had taken away the things and left them with pipes lighted that the
3512  inevitable explanation was reached.
3513  
3514  "Now then?" said Tab impatiently.
3515  
3516  His face wore a sober expression, full of expectancy, but not without a
3517  hint of annoyance and reproach. Jack blew a large smoke-ring at him, and
3518  laughed to see how in dodging it Jerry kept his solemnity unchanged.
3519  
3520  "Well, Tab," he began, "I don't suppose it's necessary to say that the
3521  idea of leaving the yacht never came into my head till I knew Mrs.
3522  Fairhew and Katr--Miss Marchfield were off to-morrow."
3523  
3524  "Heave ahead," grumpily retorted Jerry. "Don't mind me. Of course I
3525  shall be delighted to be left alone on the yacht."
3526  
3527  "Come, cheer up, old man," Jack exhorted. "Don't be grouchy. I'm awfully
3528  sorry to leave you; but of course it's only for a little while, and we
3529  shall both have compensations. I hope I shall be coming nearer
3530  to--to--well, to something definite, you know; and you'll have the Merle
3531  to do what you jolly well please with."
3532  
3533  "That's all very well, of course," Tab responded, his face relaxing a
3534  little; "but what's your game? We've beastly little money, you know; and
3535  this shore cruise of yours is bound to sop up a lot of tin."
3536  
3537  "We've money enough to carry us through," Jack declared. "I'll go to
3538  Genoa, of course. I know Italy pretty well, and I can make myself
3539  useful,--sort of 'guide, philosopher, and friend,' and courier all in
3540  one. When they go on to Naples,--well, from something Mrs. Fairhew said
3541  to-night, I think I shan't have any difficulty going on to Naples with
3542  them. A man's a handy article in traveling, you see, especially if he
3543  knows the language."
3544  
3545  Jerry regarded the captain as if his slower wits found it somewhat hard
3546  to follow the swift flights of his friend's mind.
3547  
3548  "But the Merle?" he objected. "It's bad enough for you to be skylarking
3549  about the world with the President's yacht, but when it comes to turning
3550  it over to me--Why, the old gentleman would throw five hundred fits at
3551  the bare idea."
3552  
3553  "Oh, I'll trust you there," Jack said lightly, consciously trying to
3554  make his confidence as flattering as possible. "You can manage, and do
3555  as you please for the next month. Who ever heard of a mate that didn't
3556  jump at the chance of taking command for a while. I'd advise you to
3557  stop, say, at Elba, if you're for doing the sights. Then, if you like,
3558  while you're on the Napoleonic tack, you might run 'round to Ajaccio.
3559  It's an out-of-the-way place, rather, but it's jolly when you get there.
3560  As for Elba, I've never been ashore there, though I've passed it and
3561  know the chap that owns it. I'll give you a letter in case you want to
3562  go ashore."
3563  
3564  "But, Jack--Damn it!" broke out Jerry, as if exasperated by the very
3565  feasibility of his friend's sudden change of tactics, "I can't speak a
3566  word of their blessed lingo!"
3567  
3568  "Pooh! Your French will carry you about well enough, and if worst comes
3569  to worst, you can fall back on Gonzague. At Naples you'll find them
3570  speaking English all over the lot."
3571  
3572  "Jack Castleport, you're certainly the damnedest man to handle I ever
3573  came across," Jerry said in despairing tones. "A fellow might as well
3574  try to bully-rag a sea-cow as to argue you out of any of your confounded
3575  schemes."
3576  
3577  "That's because they're so good," laughed Jack. "You see their profound
3578  wisdom carries me away so completely that objections can't touch me."
3579  Then he stretched his hand across the table corner, and caught hold of
3580  Jerry's. "I'm deuced sorry to give you the slip like this," he said,
3581  "but you know the reason."
3582  
3583  The good-natured Tab melted at once. He returned the pressure of his
3584  friend's hand and tried to quote
3585  
3586  
3587       "But when a woman's in the case,
3588       All other things, you know, give place;"
3589  
3590  
3591  but made so hopeless a mess of it that he could only break out into one
3592  of his boisterously jovial guffaws.
3593  
3594  "Well, by George," he cried, "if she only knew how devoted you are,
3595  Jack, she'd let you wait a dog's age, just to try you."
3596  
3597  They spent an hour or so in arranging details, going over charts,
3598  dividing their funds, and so on. Jack gave Tab addresses at Genoa,
3599  Florence, and Rome by which he might be reached, and told him that at
3600  Naples he should go to the Hôtel du Vesuve. On the twentieth of August
3601  Jerry was to inquire for him there. These and other affairs having been
3602  arranged, the pair smoked a final pipe, and turned in.
3603  
3604  Jack was very wakeful. He lay thinking of this and of that, restlessly
3605  tossing about in his berth. Just as at last he was dropping off to
3606  sleep, he was aroused by the voice of Jerry, who called softly across
3607  the passage:--
3608  
3609  "I say, Jack,--are you awake?"
3610  
3611  "Almost," replied Jack; "but I shouldn't have been, if you'd let me
3612  alone."
3613  
3614  "I say, Jacko, do you fancy the President came a cropper in that
3615  Tillington smashup?"
3616  
3617  "Don't know," Jack answered. "He's pretty shrewd, and Mrs. Fairhew would
3618  have been likely to hear of it, I should think, if he had come seriously
3619  to grief."
3620  
3621  "Well, you know, it struck me that perhaps that beastly letter from
3622  Tillington might have been something important, and"--
3623  
3624  "Oh, take a liver-pill!" interrupted Jack. "You've got an attack of
3625  _Conscientia Novanglicana_."
3626  
3627  "What's that?"
3628  
3629  "Forerunner of nervous pros.," replied the captain with a chuckle. "Go
3630  to sleep or you'll get it."
3631  
3632  "Well, good-night."
3633  
3634  "Good-night, boy."
3635  
3636  Silence again reigned, but Jack, once more aroused, threshed about
3637  uneasily until far into the night. Resolutely as he might determine not
3638  to think of the possible consequences of the carrying off of that big
3639  blue letter, he could not prevent doubt from recurring constantly to his
3640  mind, and something not so far removed from remorse mingled with his
3641  thoughts of Katrine and of the delight of traveling in her company. He
3642  was so long awake that on the next afternoon Mrs. Fairhew, when he had
3643  installed her and her niece comfortably in a first-class compartment on
3644  the 3.08 train, and they were beginning to see the olive groves and the
3645  villas slip picturesquely past the windows, noted the shadows beneath
3646  his eyes, and smiled to herself discreetly and unseen.

3653  Chapter Nine
3654  
3655  THE DOLDRUMS
3656  
3657  
3658  For two weeks the Merle had been lying at anchor at Naples. From Nice
3659  she had run first to Elba; thence she had doubled north again and
3660  rounded Corsica; she had touched at Calvi and Ajaccio; and lastly,
3661  running through the Straits of Bonifacio, she had held on
3662  east-southeasterly to her present anchorage off the Castle.
3663  
3664  Despite the novel pleasures of command, Taberman felt Jack's absence so
3665  much as at times to be almost unhappy, even at times a little inclined
3666  to be resentful. He was still too boyish not to feel that to leave a
3667  yacht for a girl was the height of madness, if not of idiocy; and while
3668  he was too loyal to Jack to confess this feeling even to himself, it
3669  would at times rise in his mind, especially when he felt more than
3670  usually lonely. On his arrival at any port Jerry experienced to the full
3671  the excitement which even the oldest traveler feels in some degree at
3672  entering a new town. Whenever the port officer appeared in his official
3673  dignity, another sensation was added in the fear of detection and
3674  apprehension. A reaction would set in with the departure of the easily
3675  satisfied official, and Jerry would go mooning about with his hands in
3676  his pockets, whistling some spiritless tune until the time came to get
3677  up anchor and sail anew.
3678  
3679  At Naples, however, things went somewhat better with Jerry than at any
3680  of his previous ports. In the first place even Jerry, unæsthetic as he
3681  was, could not escape the magic of the beautiful bay and the
3682  surroundings which opened up before him in the morning light as he
3683  approached the city. He said to himself, half as if in excuse for being
3684  so much pleased by mere scenery, that it looked as it should. It had, as
3685  it were, kept faith with him; and its beauty was to him an honest
3686  fulfillment of its fame. The gray cone of Vesuvius, palpably and
3687  gratifyingly like the pictures, stood at the head of the bay, crowned
3688  with an inky cloud of smoke. Away from it to the south stretched the
3689  cliffs of blue Sorrento and bluer Capri, melting magically into a
3690  background of hills or of the azure sky. On the north of the smoking
3691  cone a stretch of shadow-wrought shore, and then Naples itself, from the
3692  old Spanish fort on the water-front to the Castle of St. Elmo, long and
3693  gray, crowning the summit of the ridge behind, and the stone-pines
3694  silhouetted like palms against the sapphire sky. Naples, with its great
3695  four-square houses of pink, and white, and yellow, heaped, as it were,
3696  one above another; its red-tiled roofs, its terraces tricked out with
3697  vines or fig-trees; Naples, with its church roofs of variegated tiles,
3698  its long quays yellowish gray about the shore--Jerry could well have
3699  believed himself in some enchanted picture city, a city which might
3700  almost be expected to vanish suddenly if one should close the book it
3701  graced.
3702  
3703  Behind the Government Mole were lying five Italian battleships, their
3704  big red, white, and green flags floating over their sterns, and
3705  everywhere over the liquid blue of the bay sailed fisher-craft and small
3706  boats, gilded with the morning light.
3707  
3708  Scarcely was the Merle's anchor down than the yacht was surrounded by a
3709  gay flotilla of boats, all laden with piles of fruit or vegetables, and
3710  manned by crews as noisy as they were picturesque. Baskets heaped with
3711  figs, great piles of green melons, lemons, citrons, plums, fresh
3712  vegetables of all sorts, were there; and each ware was extolled by the
3713  vendors with vociferous volubility, until the ears of Jerry fairly sang
3714  with the din. From the crowding boats screamed blowsy, dark-eyed women
3715  with brown oval faces and raiment of reds and yellows; boys with Greek
3716  faces and slim bare arms yelled with shrill voices; doddering old men,
3717  sitting in the stern-sheets of skiffs pulled by impish youngsters, waved
3718  impotent hands and moved toothless mouths whose sounds were lost in the
3719  feverish uproar; stalwart market-men, with brown, wrinkled faces and
3720  hairy bosoms exposed, fought their way through the press, disregarding
3721  age, sex, and condition in their effort to be nearest the possible
3722  purchasers on the Merle; all around the yacht the piratical
3723  water-peddlers made a floating Pandemonium, at which the Yankee crew
3724  stared not only in surprise but with some appearance of not unnatural
3725  alarm.
3726  
3727  As an opposing bulwark to this flood of southern vivacity, old Gonzague
3728  alone stood as the spokesman of the yacht. Requested by Jerry to make
3729  the vendors "stow their jaw," he laid about him right and left with a
3730  profane volubility which outdid even that of the assailants. The old man
3731  had not spoken Italian for so long that he might well be supposed to
3732  have forgotten it, but the occasion found him splendidly adequate to all
3733  the requirements of the situation. The Neapolitans raved and pleaded,
3734  execrated and lowered their prices, with appeals to the Madonna and all
3735  the saints to witness their honesty and their liberality; but once the
3736  floodgates of Gonzague's Italian were opened, he dealt with them so
3737  eloquently and so roundly, his objurgations were so much more
3738  picturesque and more emphatic than any they could compass, that one by
3739  one they drew away baffled, calling on high Heaven and the blessed
3740  Virgin to protect them when Vesuvius should belch forth a torrent of
3741  fire to overwhelm this blasphemous and impious _vecchiastro_.
3742  
3743  Gonzague was perhaps sustained under the volleys of curses which the
3744  defeated bumboat men and women threw back at him, by the admiration with
3745  which he was regarded by the crew of the Merle. They had come to idolize
3746  the old man, and to look upon him with roughly affectionate wonder. The
3747  beauty of the scenes through which they had been passing in the
3748  Mediterranean had of course impressed them very little æsthetically, and
3749  Naples with its matchless bay they saw only with the eyes of Isle au
3750  Haut fishermen. They were, however, never tired of wonders. The
3751  childlike sailor nature is always easily touched by the marvelous, and a
3752  real volcano was something worth seeing. As long as the Merle was in
3753  sight of Vesuvius they would hang over the rail and watch it for hours.
3754  If the smoke ceased they would cluster together and discuss the
3755  probable causes; they would talk of the mountain as if it were a
3756  conscious monster, lying in wait for prey, whose every movement was to
3757  be watched with a view to detecting the sinister design that must lie
3758  behind it. When a great dun cloud would suddenly puff up from the cone,
3759  the men would greet it with deep exclamations half of awe and half of
3760  applause. Continually they beset Gonzague with questions, as if he were
3761  the keeper or the high priest of this fiery monster. They apparently had
3762  complete confidence that Gonzague could explain it all if he would. His
3763  knowledge of the language and such use of it as he made in dispersing
3764  the voluble rabble of vendors were exactly in the line of their
3765  understanding, and they followed his every movement with an admiration
3766  amusingly tinged with something not unlike uncouth reverence.
3767  
3768  On the afternoon of his arrival at Naples Taberman had gone ashore. He
3769  had landed at the steamship quay, and passed half the night in an
3770  aimless ramble. There is something about Naples at night which goes to
3771  the head like wine; especially if the head is young and set on the
3772  shoulders of one who has never before known the life of southern cities.
3773  Jerry walked from the railroad station to the Public Gardens, and from
3774  the Mola to the Hôtel Britannique upon the heights. He attempted no
3775  systematic exploration, but simply wandered with no other object than
3776  the simple delight of rambling. By daylight the picturesque streets; the
3777  variegated rabble, ragged, dirty, beautiful, impudent, at once repulsive
3778  and enchanting; the crooked, crowded ways that climb the hill; the
3779  awnings, the heaps of fruit, the strange wares, the familiar air of the
3780  family life which made of the streets a home, and seemed to turn all the
3781  inhabitants of the town into one huge family; the unconsciously artistic
3782  groups, the tumbling _bambini_, the women, bold, piquant, handsome, or
3783  ugly with a hideousness of which Jerry had never conceived,--all these
3784  things passed before him like the whirling shows of an opium dream. As
3785  night fell, and the lights appeared, the scenes through which he went
3786  half dazed and wholly delighted took on a new quality of the weird and
3787  fantastic. The flaring lamps, the mysterious shadows, the blazing colors
3788  which not even the night could subdue, the theatrical effects seen down
3789  the narrow streets as on a stage set for opera, the inexhaustible
3790  vivacity, which seemed not to diminish with the lateness of the hour,
3791  all blended in an intoxicating experience such as Taberman had never
3792  known, and indeed such as had never come into his liveliest fancy.
3793  
3794  The next day Jerry went ashore in the morning, and set himself to more
3795  regular sight-seeing under the care of a professional guide. He went
3796  over the famous Museum, saw Vergil's Tomb, Posilipo, Sanazar's house,
3797  and Marti's _pozzo_. After a capital luncheon in one of the cafés in the
3798  Arcade, he rejoined his guide, who took him to the Aquarium. On the way
3799  they stopped at the Royal Palace and the Morro, Tab being duly impressed
3800  by the grandeur of royalty and the majesty of the law. Continually he
3801  wished that Jack were with him, for he had so fallen into the habit of
3802  depending on Jack for opinions that without his friend his impressions
3803  seemed to lack the clearness of sanction. When it came to the Aquarium,
3804  however, not only did the things he had seen in his day's explorations
3805  fade from his mind, but he was too delighted not to know exactly what he
3806  felt.
3807  
3808  The Aquarium of Naples is by far the most wonderful in the world. It is
3809  smaller and less elaborate than others, as, for instance, that of the
3810  Trocadero, but it outranks all in interest and impressiveness. The
3811  virtue of the place lies in its simplicity of construction and in the
3812  rarity of its exhibits. A sense of restful shadow and coolness
3813  succeeding to outside glare and heat; a dim greenish light in broad,
3814  glass-faced tanks of sea-water; an odd feeling of being fathoms deep in
3815  a tropical sea,--these are the sensations the visitor has first in this
3816  wonderful home of strange fish in exile.
3817  
3818  Tab made the rounds half a dozen times before he could bring himself to
3819  leave. Quite unscientific, but as enthusiastic as a boy, he stood in
3820  front of each tank, and tried vainly to determine which was most
3821  fascinating. Here were spiny lobster-like crustacea, spotted with a
3822  dozen colors; there were beautiful fish with shining iridescent sides
3823  and waving filmy, vaporous tails; one tank was inhabited by repulsive,
3824  warty octopi, splotched with dull browns and plague-spots of ugly red,
3825  which melted and slimed about, so disgusting that they seemed almost
3826  obscene; from another a huge sea python, with body as large as the thigh
3827  of a man and a head like that of a bald wolf, seemed to grin with
3828  sinister, snarling face at Jerry, while all about the monster bloated
3829  globe-fish and distorted marine shapes swam and circled; in a corner
3830  tank a brood of asp-like fish, with skins that seemed of richest velvet,
3831  dusky and wonderful in hue, lay heaped like incarnate poison; and near
3832  by the angel-fish went waving and trailing their way about the sand.
3833  Jerry was perhaps most impressed, however, by the mysterious life which
3834  went on in a tank to which he came among the last. Thin, slow-waving
3835  filaments of colorless jelly, crowned with diaphanous cups, not
3836  differing greatly from the poppy-flower in shape; and near them other
3837  forms, transparent, hardly more than condensed sea-water in appearance,
3838  yet with slow pulsations, continuous and wonderful, of phosphoric
3839  sparks,--as if one saw life itself throbbing rhythmically in the
3840  pellucid hairs of jelly.
3841  
3842  Jerry had not been so completely happy since he parted from Jack. He
3843  reveled in a boyish delight, and let no wonder of the place escape him.
3844  He tipped the keeper to feed the octopi with young crabs, lowered on a
3845  string; he took a smart electric shock from a morose torpedo which lay
3846  sulkily in a small open tub with a pebbly bottom; he had the big
3847  anemones and the coral-polyps "put to sleep," in the words of his
3848  guide,--an operation consisting simply of the moving in the water of a
3849  small stick which caused them to close in alarm; he did, in a word,
3850  everything his guide could think of for him to do, and went away in the
3851  end only half content to leave.
3852  
3853  After the Aquarium, Jerry turned a deaf ear to the alluring speeches of
3854  the guide, the burden of whose song was all of curiosities unseen and of
3855  pleasures untasted. He paid the importunate manikin, and made his way
3856  back to the Merle. The truth was that he had seen something which
3857  thoroughly pleased him, and after that it was impossible to return to
3858  the perfunctory seeing of regulation sights which really did not take
3859  hold of him in the least.
3860  
3861  Before the first week was ended, Jerry had visited Pompeii and Baiæ, and
3862  what was to be seen of Herculaneum. He had made some purchases; and then
3863  he began to wait about, ashore or aboard, for Jack. That gentleman had
3864  written no response to Tab's letter announcing the arrival of the Merle
3865  at Naples, and Jerry could only think of him as so absorbed in his
3866  wooing as to have forgotten all about his friend. Some not unnatural
3867  jealousy began to ferment in his mind, and did not add to his comfort.
3868  By the advice of Gonzague he took the market-boat, and setting out early
3869  one morning he sailed with a couple of the men across the bay to Capri,
3870  where he passed the day. The only thing which cheered him on his lonely
3871  expedition was a tarantella, which was danced for his diversion by a
3872  romantic-looking _raggaza_, with black eyes and short petticoats. The
3873  moonlight sail back would have pleased him more had it not been
3874  necessary to keep the men rowing for two thirds of the way. On the
3875  whole, Jerry could find nothing to please him on land or sea.
3876  
3877  The major part of the next week he had spent stretched out in a cane
3878  _chaise longue_ in the cockpit, drinking iced sangaree and reading
3879  Didron's _Artémise_. He had a fly stretched over the awning for
3880  increased coolness, and the "dusters" put up to shut out the glare from
3881  the water; there, like some melancholy monarch beneath his canopy, he
3882  read, dozed, and grumbled--without even the satisfaction of any fit
3883  audience--from morning to sundown.
3884  
3885  In the cool of the evening he usually went ashore, and one night he was
3886  strolling along the water-front, stick in hand and his Panama set well
3887  back on his head. As he passed the Hôtel du Vesuve, wondering when Jack
3888  would arrive, a small figure moved quickly in front of him and bowed. At
3889  first he was startled, but almost instantly he saw that it was the valet
3890  de place who had gone about with him in the early days of his stay at
3891  Naples.
3892  
3893  "Hello," said Jerry in surprise, yet not without a feeling of
3894  satisfaction at finding even this apology for a companion.
3895  
3896  "_Buon' sera, signor_," responded the little man vivaciously. "How do?
3897  You tek-a de night air? _É verament' un' bellissima notte._ It mek-a
3898  cool, eh?"
3899  
3900  And he waved his arms expressively.
3901  
3902  He might have been thirty or thirty-five, and had coarse black hair,
3903  with fiery eyes. He was not ill-looking, but his clothes were hopelessly
3904  threadbare and his face pinched. He bore dark circles under his eyes,
3905  and was in no way markedly different from others of his numerous and
3906  futile class, who, with a smattering of French, German, or English,
3907  struggle desperately for a livelihood by acting, not always very
3908  virtuously, as guides for traveling _forestieri_.
3909  
3910  "You busy?" Jerry asked, a sudden thought striking him.
3911  
3912  "No--no," replied the Neapolitan, his face as eager as his tone. "What-a
3913  you like see? Eh? Some of dose oder curiosities _forse_?" he asked with
3914  a suggestive smile.
3915  
3916  "Thanks, no," Jerry returned dryly; "but if you aren't busy, I wish
3917  you'd walk along with me. I'm bored--tired--'most to death, and I fancy
3918  you might tell me how I may best kill time for the next few days."
3919  
3920  The little guide was delighted. He suggested a multitude of things which
3921  might be done,--visits to Castellmare and Sorrento or Amalfi; wonders
3922  the signor had neglected in the museum; the _pasta_ shops; and so on for
3923  a variety of possible and impossible diversions. But still Taberman
3924  shook his head. He wanted to be amused, but he was lonely and rather
3925  homesick, so that while he regretted being so difficult, nothing
3926  appealed to him. Finally, the guide, quite at his wit's end but still
3927  bland, smiling, patient, obsequious, and apparently unruffled by the
3928  careless way in which the American rejected all his suggestions one
3929  after the other, mentioned Pesto.
3930  
3931  "Pesto?" queried Tab carelessly. "What is that?"
3932  
3933  "_Si!_ Pesto. It ees dere dey hav-a de gret-a temple; t'ree gret-a
3934  temple, all put een de row-a,--_uno, due, tre_." And he held up three
3935  fingers to make his statement at once clearer and more emphatic.
3936  
3937  "Temples? Real ones?" asked Jerry. "I mean are they old--Roman, that
3938  is--or just churches?"
3939  
3940  "_Ma verament'_," laughed the valet de place, "_ci son' tre templi_;
3941  bot-a dey not-a Roman; dey Gre'k. Fin-a, big-a temple; big-a like Hôtel
3942  du Vesuve!"
3943  
3944  He waved his spread arms as if he would embrace the universe. Jerry
3945  laughed at the little man's enthusiasm, but his interest was excited.
3946  
3947  "Greek, eh?" he said. "How far is it? How do you get there?"
3948  
3949  The guide explained volubly, told the time of trains to Pæstum,
3950  declared that the trip was easily made in a day, and proffered his
3951  services as escort. This Jerry declined, quite as much from motives of
3952  economy as from any other reason; but he invited the little guide to sit
3953  down at one of the small tables on the sidewalk before Zinfoni's, where
3954  he furnished him with refreshments and made him repeat his account of
3955  the temples, the details of the journey, and whatever information he
3956  could furnish. Jerry was really lonely enough to be amused by the
3957  company of the Neapolitan, and as he sat listening and watching the
3958  people drifting past, he was soothed with the feeling of being not so
3959  entirely alone. From Zinfoni's the pair sauntered down to the quay,
3960  where they parted. The Italian was profuse in his thanks and
3961  protestations, and Jerry was considerate enough to act in such a manner
3962  as to make the little man think him the most affable of _Inglesi_.
3963  
3964  When he was aboard again, Jerry got out a chart, and after some
3965  searching located Pæstum. As it was not too far from Naples to be
3966  possible in a day, he determined upon the expedition. Jack was not due
3967  for two or three days yet, and the time must be killed somehow. He
3968  summoned Gonzague, ordered an early breakfast, told him he should be
3969  absent all the next day, and that he should leave him in charge. He had
3970  a sort of mild exhilaration at his boldness in thus venturing off into
3971  the midst of a land whose language he could not speak, and he went to
3972  bed that night with a great feeling of relief. The doldrums were over;
3973  he had something to do to bridge the time until Jack came.

3980  Chapter Ten
3981  
3982  MR. WRENMARSH, THE EXTRAORDINARY
3983  
3984  
3985  On the following morning, as, a few minutes after nine, the southbound
3986  train from Naples to Tarento drew out of the station, Taberman, winking
3987  a little at the sudden glare of the sun, began to look about him. The
3988  morning promised a hot day, and his comfort in traveling was likely to
3989  be lessened by the fact that in the second-class compartment with him
3990  were five Italians. They had already settled themselves back against the
3991  cushions, turning upward sunburnt, perspiring faces, and allowing
3992  themselves to be jolted by the train like so many dead-weights. Their
3993  ugly straw hats, high-crowned and narrow-brimmed, were set on their
3994  knees or wedged beside them on the seat; two of the travelers had gay
3995  bandannas tucked into their collars about their throats. One man--a
3996  pursy old codger in the corner--had lighted, after a mumbled "con
3997  permesso," a long Virginia, which filled the compartment with a thin
3998  blue haze and an acrid smell as of burning leather.
3999  
4000  The train rumbled along over a dubious roadbed, flanked by its
4001  cinder-strewn berms; and Tab, looking through the window on his right,
4002  recognized the line as that by which he had gone to Pompeii. At times
4003  the train went close to where the curling ripples of the sapphirine bay
4004  were breaking gently on the shore; sometimes it ran through small
4005  hamlets, and again passed country places where the busy peasants were at
4006  work in the rich vineyards, the orchards, or the tilled fields.
4007  
4008  At the end of half an hour, they stopped at Pompeii for a moment, and
4009  Jerry, through the opposite window, recognized the station and the
4010  paltry inn beyond. As the train drew out again, he caught brief glimpses
4011  of the ancient city, dull red-brown walls among the silver-gray of the
4012  olive-trees.
4013  
4014  The train sped on southward. It dipped into little vales, and wound its
4015  way up and into the hills that ring themselves around the plain of
4016  Pæstum. In an hour's time they pulled up at a small town on the left of
4017  the track. Jerry made out the name of the station, enameled in big white
4018  letters on a blue field, Battapaglia. The guard came by, unlocking the
4019  compartment doors, and as the men in his compartment got out and left
4020  their luggage behind them, Jerry concluded that here was to be a wait
4021  of some minutes. He therefore followed the example of his fellow
4022  travelers, and stepped down upon the sunny platform. It was very hot.
4023  Tab mopped his face with his handkerchief and turned down the brim of
4024  his Panama all around.
4025  
4026  "_Graniti, signor? Citron? Orang'?_"
4027  
4028  A small boy had singled him out, probably because he was the only
4029  _forestiere_ on the platform, and was offering him syrupy drinks cooled
4030  with cracked ice. For a soldo Tab secured a glass of sherbet,
4031  fruit-juice and water half frozen and very delicious. It was so
4032  refreshing that he bestowed an extra soldo on the vender in sheer
4033  gratitude. The lad rewarded him with a curt "grazie," and a look half
4034  grateful and half suspicious, and then hastened on to urge his wares on
4035  other travelers. Jerry looked after him in amusement at the fringe made
4036  by the tatters of his trousers, and in lazy admiration of the sinewy
4037  brown arms left bare by the sleeveless cotton shirt and of the jaunty
4038  poise of the curly head.
4039  
4040  The train still waited.
4041  
4042  Jerry lighted a cigarette and got into the shadow of the cars. Presently
4043  a big express came thundering out of the pass in the hills with a roar,
4044  and rushed away to southward on the main track.
4045  
4046  "_Pronto! Partenza! Partenza!_" cried the guard, with a blast of his
4047  horn.
4048  
4049  The road was again clear, the express-mail having passed. The passengers
4050  clambered aboard, and settled themselves in their former places. The old
4051  man with the Virginia had purchased a copy of "Il Papagallo," though it
4052  was a mystery how he could have got hold of it in such a place. He
4053  clucked oilily as he read, occasionally calling the attention of his
4054  nearest neighbor to some gaudy cartoon or some political pasquinade.
4055  Jerry speculated in regard to what it might all be about, and was filled
4056  with that vague sense of baffled irritation which comes from seeing
4057  others enjoying jokes in a language one cannot understand.
4058  
4059  Mile after mile of level track, flanked by the interminable
4060  cinder-covered berms. Once in a while the level was broken by clumps of
4061  dusty cactus, ugly and forbiddingly aggressive in the sun. To the right,
4062  beyond a flat, gorse-grown waste, relieved only by an occasional palm or
4063  oleaster, Tab could discern the blue shimmer of the sea. To the left, he
4064  could see only the same dull plain, bounded by bluish hills, which rose
4065  about it like the seats of some titanic amphitheatre. Now and again two
4066  or three buffaloes, their black hides caked with patches of yellow mud,
4067  lay in their wallows or stood contemptuously indifferent to the noisy
4068  train, which beside them seemed so impertinently modern.
4069  
4070  At last the train, with a screaming of gritty brakes on the wheels, and
4071  the inevitable clanking and banging of cars and couplings, drew up
4072  beside a tiny station on the right of the track.
4073  
4074  "Pesto! Pesto!"
4075  
4076  The guard unlocked the compartment door, and Jerry stepped out. The
4077  station was smaller than any they had passed, and Tab smilingly
4078  reflected that the lodge at the entrance of his father's place at Dedham
4079  was bigger. He was the only passenger to alight, and no sooner was he
4080  out than the guard, like an overgrown mechanical toy, called out his
4081  "_Pronto! Partenza!_" blew his toy horn, and swung himself aboard again.
4082  The long train, with bitter metallic complaint at being obliged to go
4083  farther, drew past the little station, and rolled away toward a gap in
4084  the southern hills, far beyond which lies Tarento.
4085  
4086  Taberman turned to the station master, a discouraged-looking individual
4087  who stood on the platform with his truncheon tucked under his arm,
4088  examining a batch of dispatches as if this were the first time such
4089  papers had ever come under his notice. Jerry's Italian vocabulary was
4090  limited to some score of words, with a few expressions, such as _dolce
4091  far niente_ and the like, more ornamental than useful. As, however, he
4092  could perceive no sign of any temples,--or town either, for the matter
4093  of that,--he determined to question the _capo_.
4094  
4095  "_Bonn giorno_," he began with a painful sense of effort, but with a
4096  mild self-congratulatory thrill at having said something in Italian.
4097  
4098  "_Buon' giorno_," responded the station master, turning a pair of dull
4099  eyes and an emaciated face from the dispatches to Taberman.
4100  
4101  Jerry spoke French moderately well, and resolved to address the official
4102  in that tongue, in the hope that the Italian might understand.
4103  
4104  "Peut-être vous parlez Français?" he began.
4105  
4106  "_Cosa?_" asked the Italian, obviously puzzled, as he stepped out of the
4107  sun into the shadow of the little station.
4108  
4109  "What?" demanded Jerry in English, and with much the same puzzled air.
4110  
4111  "_Non capisco_," said the man, with a sort of dull finality.
4112  
4113  Conversation languished. Jerry felt himself pretty well baffled, yet he
4114  had no choice but to go on with the unpromising attempt to elicit
4115  information here, as no other human being was in sight. He considered a
4116  moment, and then in an explosive tone, demanded:--
4117  
4118  "_Templi?_"
4119  
4120  "_Bruto Inglise!_" murmured the _capo_ under his breath. "_Che volete?_"
4121  he added aloud.
4122  
4123  "What?" asked Jerry, again scared over the dubious boundary of his
4124  Italian into English.
4125  
4126  "_Non capisco_," repeated the Italian morosely, wetting his dingy
4127  forefinger, and going over his papers for at least the third time.
4128  
4129  "Damn it!" cried Jerry, in complete exasperation, "if you say that again
4130  I'll punch your head!"
4131  
4132  The other started back in such obvious terror that Tab hastened to
4133  propitiate him by putting on quickly his most ingratiating smile, and
4134  nodding as if he had made a merry joke. The other seemed reassured,
4135  although he edged away a little, as if he were doubtful of the sanity of
4136  this foreign brute; and Tab fell again to the effort to rally all the
4137  words in his Italian vocabulary about one idea.
4138  
4139  "_Dove_," he began in one grand final attempt to wring information out
4140  of this sullen and taciturn official, "_dove_"-- He was so pleased with
4141  himself for having remembered the word that he came near forgetting all
4142  the rest, but with a desperate rally, he went blundering on. "_Dove_, I
4143  say, is--is--_la via per i templi_?"
4144  
4145  The _capo_ looked at him, apparently in mingled curiosity and disgust.
4146  Then he beckoned him to the edge of the platform on the other side of
4147  the station, whence stretched westward a ribbon of dust-heaped road.
4148  
4149  "_Ecco-la_" he ejaculated, waving his truncheon vaguely toward the
4150  distance.
4151  
4152  "Ah," said Jerry, "_grazie_."
4153  
4154  As the _capo_ responded to this speech not at all, Tab set out on the
4155  dusty road without more ado. The way was inches deep in loose, gray
4156  dust, and spiny cacti bristled on either hand. Jerry had not gone far
4157  before, turning a bend, he saw at no great distance ahead of him an
4158  arched gateway through which the road passed. The arch, broken and
4159  crumbled, was set in a ruined wall, which trailed away on either hand,
4160  now rising to the height of something like a dozen feet, now razed to
4161  the very ground.
4162  
4163  "That's a forlorn-looking piece o' work," commented Tab aloud.
4164  
4165  Had Jerry been blessed with the education of his forefathers, instead of
4166  having brought out of school and college a hodgepodge smattering of
4167  physics and economics, he might have known and reflected that the wall
4168  he thus carelessly characterized had been standing some two thousand
4169  years, and gloriously attested the puissance of old Rome. With no such
4170  thought, however, he passed beneath the crumbling gateway and continued
4171  his march. At some distance ahead he now perceived signs of life in the
4172  shape of a few dwellings.
4173  
4174  As he looked at them he became aware of two horsemen, who were cantering
4175  toward him on the crest of the little slope made by the road just inside
4176  the old gateway. Their horses' hoofs stirred up light clouds of yellow
4177  dust. Even at first glance the riders showed themselves to be ruggedly
4178  dressed, and with something of a thrill Jerry noticed instantly that
4179  slung across their shoulders they carried carbines. Wild tales of
4180  brigands flashed confusedly through his brain, and especially a tale the
4181  Neapolitan guide had related of the capture and murder at this very
4182  place of an English gentleman and his wife. The guide had said that that
4183  was sixteen years ago, but the place seemed sq lonely, so remote, Tab's
4184  ideas of rural Italy were so vague, the effect of the landscape and of
4185  these wild figures was so startling as, riding toward him, they stood
4186  out against the sky, that it was no wonder Jerry involuntarily cast a
4187  quick glance around to note the lay of the land and to see if any
4188  possible help were in sight in case of need.
4189  
4190  The horsemen rode down to him on a lazy lope. They were big, bronzed
4191  fellows, smoking cigarettes, and riding with their feet out of the
4192  stirrups. They nodded to him pleasantly and smiled, showing large white
4193  teeth. They had about them, these big fellows, a look so engaging that
4194  Tab was won at once, and the vague mist of his suspicions vanished like
4195  smoke in air. He grinned to himself at the idea of brigands.
4196  
4197  "_Dove templi?_" he asked, returning their salutation.
4198  
4199  The big men smiled more broadly, and one of them replied in French.
4200  
4201  "Vous ne parlez pas beaucoup d'italien?" he asked in a pleasant voice.
4202  
4203  "Ne pas de tout!" responded Jerry heartily, with a laugh.
4204  
4205  Having found some one with whom he could talk, he at once began a lively
4206  conversation. He found the two men to be the custodians appointed by the
4207  government to look after the temples and to collect the fees of
4208  travelers. They explained that at this season it was extremely rare for
4209  a visitor to appear, and that they were therefore not particular about
4210  being exactly at their posts. They had heard some rumor of the discovery
4211  of antiques by peasants, and were setting out to investigate. They
4212  explained, however, that the chances of finding out anything were very
4213  small; the peasants all held together, and would all lie for one
4214  another. Jerry inferred, moreover, that they were by no means anxious to
4215  make discoveries. It was part of their duty to investigate such a rumor,
4216  for the government claimed the right to have a hand in the disposal of
4217  any treasure-trove; but the custodians seemed to have a good deal of
4218  sympathy with the wretched peasants, who tried to conceal anything they
4219  might find, in order to sell it for a fraction of its value to any stray
4220  _forestiere_ who might appear. Now that a visitor had come, one of the
4221  men went alone on this errand, and the custode who spoke French returned
4222  toward the temples, which were near at hand, that he might formally take
4223  Tab's lira at the gate.
4224  
4225  The Italian walked his horse beside Taberman past the two or three
4226  ruinous and apparently deserted houses, and in a few minutes the pair
4227  came to where their road ended in a broad turnpike which ran at right
4228  angles to it. On the other side of this turnpike, a little distance to
4229  his left, Jerry saw the ruins of a couple of temples, and beyond them
4230  the sea. His guide disregarded them, and led him to the right hand,
4231  where, a hundred yards or so along the highway, they came to a square
4232  two-story building of gray rubble. On its dingy front was painted in
4233  black letters the word "Osteria."
4234  
4235  "V'là l'auberge," announced the jovial custodian. "If Michu is fatigued,
4236  he can get eggs and polenta within. The wine is rough, but not so bad as
4237  the water. This way, Michu."
4238  
4239  And leaving his horse to crop the rank grass by the doorway, he strode
4240  into the building, Tab following.
4241  
4242  The inn was a poor place, even for southern Italy. The floor was of
4243  trampled clay; the walls were unfinished within as without, but like the
4244  ceiling, from which hung bunches of garlic and black and dusty herbs,
4245  they were garnished with abundant cobwebs and a generous coating of soot
4246  and dirt. At the back of the room was a counter, above which a grimy
4247  sign announced the right of the proprietor to sell salt and tobacco. In
4248  the left-hand corner of the back of the place was one of the altar-like
4249  ranges of Italy, upon which glowed a minute heap of charcoal. Tab smiled
4250  to find himself recognizing its use from its resemblance to the
4251  cooking-places he had seen in the ruins of Pompeii, and reflected, with
4252  the superiority of a youth born in a young land, upon the conservatism
4253  which keeps its kitchen arrangements practically the same as they were
4254  two thousand years ago. The room was lighted simply by the door through
4255  which the visitors had entered. Another doorway at the left simply
4256  yawned blackly like the mouth of a cavern. The furniture consisted of a
4257  small square table and three stools. Over the entire place was spread an
4258  appearance of squalor and neglect, depressing, but in key with the air
4259  of poverty and of deadness which had been more evident to Tab with every
4260  step he had taken in Pæstum.
4261  
4262  The room was empty when they entered it, but after the custode had
4263  bellowed lustily once or twice for "Angelo," the innkeeper appeared
4264  suddenly. He was a little man doubled up as if with rheumatism, and with
4265  a face as yellow as a dried lemon. On seeing Taberman he croaked
4266  something to the custode, and bowed to his guest again and again,
4267  rubbing his hands and all but losing his crooked balance with each
4268  genuflection.
4269  
4270  With the air of an archduke ordering a banquet for his retainers,
4271  Jerry's companion gave some rapid instructions to the innkeeper, told
4272  the Michu to make the place his own, and then departed to attend to his
4273  horse and other trifles, saying that he would be back in half an hour.
4274  
4275  Tab seated himself on a stool to await his luncheon. His host puttered
4276  about the altar, occasionally mumbling to himself, like the devotee of
4277  some Stygian power making sacrifice. Jerry was watching him with
4278  amusement, and wondering what would be the outcome of his incantations
4279  in the way of food, when on a sudden the doorway was darkened, and a man
4280  entered the room. At a glance Jerry saw that the newcomer was, like
4281  himself, a traveler. The stranger was of medium height, rather inclined,
4282  hardly to stoutness, but certainly to plumpness; he was well
4283  proportioned, with broad shoulders, but had a carriage curiously
4284  shuffling and insignificant. He held a stiff-brimmed straw hat in his
4285  hand, and Tab could see, where the outer light fell upon his crown, that
4286  his hair was slightly touched with gray. His face, Jerry decided, would
4287  have been handsome, had it not been marred by two deep lines from the
4288  nostrils to the corners of the mouth, which gave an appearance of
4289  sinister suspicion not without a hint of selfish cruelty. Except for a
4290  very silky mustache, he was clean-shaven.
4291  
4292  The traveler threw Taberman a quick, almost furtive glance, and then,
4293  turning to the innkeeper, addressed that individual sharply in Italian.
4294  The crooked host bowed furiously, made apologetic and deprecatory
4295  gestures with the rapidity of a mountebank, skipped about in feverish
4296  excitement, and jerked his head more and more frantically. The
4297  gentleman--for he seemed one--continued his objurgations unappeased by
4298  all these demonstrations, and ended by swearing roundly in English.
4299  
4300  "Oh!" exclaimed Taberman involuntarily.
4301  
4302  The stranger turned to him.
4303  
4304  "I beg your pardon," he said in a curious sing-song voice with a
4305  markedly rising inflection, "but this brute has not prepared my
4306  luncheon. Do you mind sharing the table with me?"
4307  
4308  "Not the least in the world," replied Jerry. "I'm sure it will give me
4309  great pleasure."
4310  
4311  "Good," said the stranger. "I see you are an American," he flung out as
4312  an addition.
4313  
4314  "I am," returned Taberman, feeling a simple pride in the fact.
4315  
4316  "Thank God I'm not," remarked the stranger. His voice showed no trace of
4317  truculence; it was murmured as if to himself. Before Jerry had time to
4318  explode the gentleman continued: "I'm English. What does that mean?
4319  Celt, Angle, Saxon, and ages of tradition--ages of it. By the bye, you
4320  mustn't mind the things I say, you know; your pernicious self-respect
4321  would force you to resent them if you did. May I ask your name?"
4322  
4323  "My name is Taberman," Jerry replied, struggling with a mingling of
4324  indignation, amazement, and amusement, "Jerrold Taberman. I live in
4325  Boston."
4326  
4327  "Dedham rather," returned the other easily. "I knew a Taberman when I
4328  was in college. Curious chap. I-- My name's Wrenmarsh, Gordon Wrenmarsh.
4329  Fact is, I was an American, but I couldn't stand the place. Bostonians
4330  have good manners; but New York is a vile spot. So is Boston; that is--
4331  Well, perhaps you see the difference."
4332  
4333  The tricks this extraordinary man played with his voice were
4334  astonishing, and as he went on talking he quite dizzied Tab by the
4335  cryptic, baffling nature of his nervous speeches. He had, too, a curious
4336  and disconcerting habit of displaying great emotional intensity--opening
4337  his eyes to their greatest extent and distending his nostrils--in
4338  dealing with trifles of the slightest consequence; while whenever, as
4339  happened once or twice in the course of the luncheon, they touched even
4340  remotely on subjects of really vital importance, the extraordinary Mr.
4341  Wrenmarsh fairly oozed indifference. His conduct was so thoroughly
4342  strange that once or twice Jerry felt a puzzled doubt whether the man
4343  were entirely sane.
4344  
4345  "I'll tell you," said Mr. Wrenmarsh, when their slight repast was over,
4346  "we'll do the temples together. I've been camping in this abominable
4347  hole of an _osteria_ for over a week, so that I know them pretty well.
4348  One of them is in my period, moreover."
4349  
4350  Jerry looked at him as if to ask if the stranger claimed to be a
4351  contemporary of the ruins.
4352  
4353  "Your period?" he echoed confusedly.
4354  
4355  "Yes; you see, I'm an archæologist--collector, in fact. Hello; here's
4356  the custode."
4357  
4358  The custodian entered as Mr. Wrenmarsh spoke, and Taberman had somehow
4359  the idea that the look he gave the Englishman was not very friendly.
4360  
4361  "Ah, Michu, have you found a friend?" he asked in his queer French.
4362  
4363  "I don't know," Jerry returned, with a half laugh.
4364  
4365  "Well," responded the Italian, "if Michu is ready to see the temples, I
4366  am waiting."
4367  
4368  "Bien," responded Jerry; and then turning to the archæologist, he asked,
4369  "Are you coming?"
4370  
4371  "Of course," the Englishman answered. "Never mind this custode; he's
4372  only an ignorant pig."
4373  
4374  Jerry secretly felt that, ignorant or not, the big Italian, with his
4375  merry face and open smile, would be a much more companionable guide than
4376  the eccentric collector; but without comment he paid the reckoning, and
4377  they set out. They went down the road to a gate, paid a lira each to the
4378  custode, and entered upon a field of ploughed land, planted with maize.
4379  The Italian, who had more and more the air of not liking the Englishman,
4380  made some remarks to the effect that Michu l'Anglaise was a very learned
4381  man, and one much better fitted to explain the marvels of ancient
4382  architecture than he, a plain man who had had to pick up his education
4383  in the army. On these grounds he excused himself and went into a little
4384  lodge, while the others walked on to the temples which stood before
4385  them, ideal in their beauty.
4386  
4387  The two pushed their way across the field and entered the nearest
4388  temple. Jerry's was not an impressionable nature, and in one way to him
4389  these august colonnades meant little; yet despite a certain sophomoric
4390  exuberance which he had never outgrown, his nature was fundamentally too
4391  refined to fail to respond to the silent grandeur of this solemn harmony
4392  in stone. The roofless enclosure, after all the indignities a score of
4393  centuries had been able to inflict upon it, possessed still a nobility
4394  and a beauty which seemed almost personal and conscious. One feels in
4395  seeing the ruins at Pæstum as if a certain inherent and indestructible
4396  loveliness would pervade the very stones were they thrown down to the
4397  last one; and while the columns stand, the place is one to make the
4398  visitor catch his breath with admiration and almost with awe. Taberman
4399  did not analyze, and indeed he was instinctively so occupied in
4400  concealing from his companion how profoundly he was impressed as to have
4401  little attention left for introspection; but he was more deeply stirred
4402  than he could have conceived possible.
4403  
4404  He walked about with Mr. Wrenmarsh, who talked along in his curious
4405  voice, expatiating upon styles and orders, influence and epochs, with
4406  all sorts of things of which Jerry understood at best not more than a
4407  quarter; until at last, instead of going on to the neighboring temple,
4408  the strangely assorted pair sat down on the western steps of the ruin
4409  through which they had come. Taberman looked away westward, where the
4410  rim of the sea shone like a fillet of molten silver. For some time
4411  neither spoke; but at length Mr. Wrenmarsh broke in upon Tab's train of
4412  thought with a question.
4413  
4414  "Are you traveling alone?" he asked quite suddenly.
4415  
4416  Taberman explained that he had come over from America in a yacht. It is
4417  to be feared that it was vanity which led him to make the unlucky
4418  addition that he was in command of her until his friend should rejoin
4419  him at Naples.
4420  
4421  "Ah," commented the archæologist, with a new appearance of interest;
4422  "you're cruising."
4423  
4424  "Yes," said Jerry.
4425  
4426  The spell of the temple was upon him, and he had no inclination to talk.
4427  He was conscious of a half-defined desire to have this stranger take
4428  himself off, and not bother him further with questions.
4429  
4430  "And what do you suppose I am doing here?" queried the collector in a
4431  tone of almost fierce intensity.
4432  
4433  "Why," Jerry responded rather absently, "I supposed you were studying or
4434  something."
4435  
4436  "Why, yes, to be sure I am; haven't I told the custode so?" chuckled Mr.
4437  Wrenmarsh. His laughter was as extraordinary as his speech and manner.
4438  He would double up as if with a sort of a spasm and snigger gastrically.
4439  "But that's not all," he went on, as Jerry turned to look at him
4440  questioningly; "that's not all. I'm doing something else. I'm waiting."
4441  
4442  "What for?" asked Taberman, seeing that he was expected to speak.
4443  
4444  "Help," replied Wrenmarsh laconically.
4445  
4446  "Help?" repeated Jerry blankly.
4447  
4448  "Yes, help; waiting. Collecting is nothing but waiting anyway,--waiting
4449  for news, waiting for funds, waiting for auctions, waiting for old
4450  countesses to die, waiting for some fool of a peasant to discover
4451  something; waiting, waiting, waiting all along the line. It's the man
4452  who waits with his ears and eyes open and his mouth shut that gets what
4453  he wants. He's the man."
4454  
4455  "But--but what sort of help do you want now?" Tab inquired.
4456  
4457  He was sympathetic by nature, and this extraordinary individual had
4458  aroused not only his curiosity, but in some mysterious manner stimulated
4459  him to a desire to be of service. He had come to Pæstum for amusement.
4460  He felt that in meeting the collector he had been amply repaid. The
4461  unwonted emotion which had been stirred by the temple melted in his
4462  boyish heart before the warmer human interest which the collector
4463  aroused, and it was perhaps with some unrealized relief at getting back
4464  to more familiar levels of feeling that he now began to enter into the
4465  affairs of his companion. It came over him that he was being appealed
4466  to, and he was ready to take the position that if any aid of his could
4467  bring relief to Mr. Wrenmarsh, that eccentric gentleman should no longer
4468  need to go on waiting for help.
4469  
4470  "I'll tell you the whole business," said the archæologist, in a sudden
4471  burst of frankness. "You look trustworthy. I've been here ten
4472  days--waiting. I've written, of course, for help; but it doesn't seem to
4473  come. Three weeks ago I was in Naples, and heard--no matter how--that
4474  somewhere down here a lot of good stuff had turned up. I kept coming
4475  down here daily until, by dint of discreet questions--discretion's the
4476  backbone of the game--I found out what had happened. A peasant here had
4477  been spading over some ground. One day the earth sunk suddenly under
4478  him, and down he went into a hole. He found, as soon as he could get his
4479  wits together, that he had broken through the roof of an ancient _cella_
4480  of some sort. He got out without much trouble, pulled himself together,
4481  and did what any peasant would know enough to do,--covered the place
4482  with brush and dirt so that no news of the thing should get to the
4483  custodi. Then he went on with his spading."
4484  
4485  "Without investigating?" asked Jerry, full of interest.
4486  
4487  Mr. Wrenmarsh looked at him curiously.
4488  
4489  "Of course," he responded. "If he had let his curiosity get the better
4490  of him, or his tongue wag, he'd be a good deal poorer than he is at
4491  present. They are stupid louts, these peasants, but they do learn
4492  enough not to take the government into their confidence when they find
4493  anything. They know that they'd get nothing out of it if they did.
4494  Besides, they are as stolid as buffaloes. They can wait well enough."
4495  
4496  "But what did he find?" demanded Taberman, his interest thoroughly
4497  aroused by this tale of treasure-trove, which appealed to every boyish
4498  and every adventurous fibre in him.
4499  
4500  "He went by night with a lantern and a couple of panniers. He filled his
4501  baskets twice, filled them with priceless things in a perfect
4502  condition--beautiful kylixes and glass bowls. There's one that measures
4503  at least half a metre across the top. Think of that! Why, it's the
4504  finest glass I've ever seen or heard of! It's the finest glass there
4505  is!"
4506  
4507  "Great Scott!" cried Jerry, alive with excitement. "It must be awfully
4508  old!"
4509  
4510  "Old!" retorted Wrenmarsh with scorn; "do you know where you are?"
4511  
4512  Jerry twisted his head to look up at the tall columns and broken
4513  pediment above him, on the pinkish-gray stones of which the afternoon
4514  sun fell with loving warmth.
4515  
4516  "Yes, of course," he said. "But what did he do with the things?"
4517  
4518  "I kept at him till I wormed the whole business out of him," the
4519  collector answered, "and I bought his things--damn him!"
4520  
4521  He brought out the objurgation with amazing vigor; then stopped and
4522  stared gloomily before him.
4523  
4524  "Well?" said Jerry. "What are you waiting for? More?"
4525  
4526  "More!" exploded the collector, disgust and indignation in his face.
4527  "Man, I've got hold of a collection that is all but unique! More! Don't
4528  you see--I can't get away with it! Piece by piece I could run it out of
4529  the country, but I don't dare to leave anything behind me. If only my
4530  men were at hand--but they're not, they're not. One's off the track in
4531  the T road, and the other's in America."
4532  
4533  He passed his hand before his eyes with a gesture so expressive that it
4534  was even more impassioned than his tone.
4535  
4536  Taberman was moved, both by the enthusiasm of this man for his work and
4537  by the exciting romance of the finding of this treasure. He knew vaguely
4538  of the laws that forbade the taking of works of art out of Italy and
4539  Greece, but he had no conception that they were strictly enforced. It
4540  gave him a new sensation to be thus brought in contact with the actual
4541  working of a statute which was aimed to prevent a man from removing his
4542  own possessions from one country to another. He had been too well
4543  brought up under a high protective tariff to have any moral scruples
4544  about smuggling anything. A Mugwump atmosphere had acted upon the
4545  natural inclination of youth to defy authority, and had bred in Jerry
4546  the feeling that smuggling, however little its true nature was
4547  appreciated in high places, was really in its essence a maligned virtue.
4548  In the present instance, moreover, the boyish feeling that what one owns
4549  is his to do what he chooses with despite all fiats of principalities,
4550  potentates, and powers, helped to make the idea of this especial case of
4551  an attempt to defy the laws one of particular merit. He gave himself
4552  eagerly to considering how it could be done.
4553  
4554  "Can't you take your traps to Naples, and ship 'em from there?" he at
4555  last demanded of the archæologist.
4556  
4557  "You don't understand, I'm afraid," replied the other. "My reputation in
4558  itself compels me to lie close. Besides that, there's the awkward
4559  problem of the octroi and the export examinations. I couldn't take the
4560  things into Naples without running into the one, or out of it without
4561  getting afoul of the other. They'd be no end sharp in examining
4562  anything I tried to pass. I'm hideously notorious in Italy." His pride
4563  in this last statement was entirely evident, but Jerry was impressed by
4564  the deeds of archæological daring which were implied in such a
4565  reputation. "I simply can't get these things away without help," he
4566  continued. "I've written and telegraphed to every mortal I can count
4567  on,--there are only five or six of them,--and not one of them can help
4568  me out just now. Meanwhile I starve on eggs and polenta, under the
4569  suspicious eyes of the custodi--damn 'em! They'd have got me a week ago
4570  if they'd had any brains."
4571  
4572  "Upon my word," cried Jerry, the idea suddenly striking him for the
4573  first time, "it's extraordinary you should tell me all this, and I a
4574  stranger."
4575  
4576  "I count on your helping me," responded Mr. Wrenmarsh in keenly incisive
4577  tones.
4578  
4579  "My helping you!" ejaculated Tab in amazement. "What in the world have I
4580  to do with the business?"
4581  
4582  "You practically said so," returned the collector. "At least your face
4583  did." He looked at Jerry, and then turned away to the brown expanse of
4584  plain in a manner so stricken and so reproachful that Taberman could not
4585  help feeling convicted of consummate wickedness. "I counted on you," he
4586  added, in a tone of profoundest pathos.
4587  
4588  Jerry was completely nonplussed. He felt that he was being played with;
4589  he was angrily conscious that the whole affair was no concern of his,
4590  and that he had no business to be dragged into it. Yet he felt no less
4591  but rather more keenly that he could not endure the imputation of having
4592  encouraged a man in difficulties with a hope of assistance and of having
4593  then refused to fulfill them. His youthful blood, moreover, was stirred
4594  by the flavor of adventure which came alluringly to his inner sense. For
4595  a moment there was a strained silence, and then it was broken by Tab.
4596  
4597  "You've mistaken my interest for something else, I'm afraid," he said,
4598  trying to speak lightly, and feeling that he was making a mess of it.
4599  "It never even occurred to me that I could help you out of this blessed
4600  muss; and I don't see that there's anything I can do anyway, except to
4601  keep mum about it. Of course that I'd do anyway."
4602  
4603  "No use," retorted the archæologist. "If you can help me and won't,
4604  after my taking you into my confidence, you--you ruin me."
4605  
4606  "Hmm," Jerry observed rather coldly, "that's too subtle for me. I fail
4607  to see it in that light. You're no worse off than you were before."
4608  
4609  "I'm sure, Mr. Tableman"--
4610  
4611  "Taberman," Jerry corrected.
4612  
4613  "Pardon me, Mr. Taberman; but you don't see the _catena logica_ by which
4614  I arrive at my conclusions!" Mr. Wrenmarsh, both in speech and gestures,
4615  was momentarily growing more and more theatrical. "Suppose you should,
4616  knowing my story and the law against taking works of art out of the
4617  country, tell my case to the police. What then?"
4618  
4619  "It would be the trick of a blackguard, of course," Jerry replied
4620  promptly, "but"--
4621  
4622  "_Momento!_" interrupted the other, holding up his hand. "Now suppose
4623  things to be as they are, and you learn that the custodi are on my
4624  track"--
4625  
4626  "They've heard something of the find," interposed Jerry; "they told me
4627  that."
4628  
4629  "There! You see!" Wrenmarsh said, with a gesture which seemed to appeal
4630  to all humanity to bear witness that in whatever he had said he had been
4631  completely right. "Suppose, now, that you have--with perfect security to
4632  yourself, mind--a chance to give me a friendly word of warning, and
4633  don't do it. What then?"
4634  
4635  "Why," Tab answered, feeling every moment more and more as if he were
4636  being snarled up in a web, "it would be, in such a case as you suppose,
4637  a pretty shabby trick, of course. At the same time"--
4638  
4639  "Wait a bit," cried Mr. Wrenmarsh, again interrupting him, and growing
4640  visibly more excited still; "wait a bit. I want you to consider the
4641  present case. You say yourself the secret is leaking out, and of course
4642  every moment makes my danger greater. With practically no bother and
4643  with absolute safety you can help me out of the whole tangle. If you
4644  don't, I shall be caught; I shall lose this incomparable treasure and
4645  all the money I paid for it,--and that's no small sum, let me tell
4646  you,--and all because you, my forlorn hope that I've confided in _in
4647  rebus angustis_, won't devote twenty-four hours of your time to saving
4648  your own self-respect. By Jove!" he cried, starting to his feet, "if you
4649  don't help me you betray me as much as if you went straight to the
4650  custodi with my story."
4651  
4652  "Sit tight!" cried Jerry, startled by the violence of the other's
4653  demonstration. "Sit tight!"
4654  
4655  "Will you help me?" demanded Mr. Wrenmarsh, his brown eyes blazing.
4656  "Will you help--help me to dodge these Italian robbers and get my
4657  things--my antiquities that I have paid for with hard cash--out of this
4658  rotten country? Will you help, or will you desert me, and take sides
4659  with those that are waiting to rob me?"
4660  
4661  "By George, I've a mind to try!" incautiously ejaculated Jerry, for the
4662  moment carried off his balance by the enthusiasm and the persuasive
4663  personality of the other.
4664  
4665  "Good man!" cried the antiquarian in a rapture; "good man! I knew you
4666  would. We'll beat 'em! I"--
4667  
4668  "Hold your horses a bit!" put in Tab hastily, taken aback by the force
4669  Wrenmarsh gave to his unconsidered words. "Go slow, please. I may
4670  have"--
4671  
4672  "Oh, that's all right," returned the collector impetuously. "We'll take
4673  a turn down the road, and plan it all out. I can think better when I'm
4674  walking--sort of peripatetic, you see. Ha, ha!--and it'll look queer if
4675  you don't go down to see the other temple. Come on."
4676  
4677  Mr. Wrenmarsh made his way toward the road, trampling impetuously over
4678  the wild thyme and the acanthus, while Taberman followed in a mixture of
4679  amused amazement and indignation, but with a full determination to
4680  expostulate. He found, however, that he was not allowed any opportunity
4681  for remonstrance. Every sentence he began was choked off with some fresh
4682  exclamation of gratitude from the collector, or by some burst of
4683  delight that out of the skies, as it were, he had fallen to be the
4684  savior of the perplexed archæologist. By the time they had walked around
4685  the third temple, which stands at some distance from the other two,
4686  Taberman had given up protesting. He merely listened to his companion's
4687  bewildering flow of talk, and felt as if he were being drawn into a
4688  whirlpool. He was helped by his own secret delight at the thought of
4689  having a share in a real adventure, and perhaps pushed on by a boyish
4690  shame at the idea of seeming to draw back and to fail another in an
4691  extremity. He had not much chance to speak,--but he soon found that what
4692  he did say was in the line of his having accepted the position into
4693  which Mr. Wrenmarsh had been endeavoring to force him.
4694  
4695  As they returned from the third temple they found the custode beside the
4696  fountain which stood across the road from the inn. He was trying to
4697  teach his horse to shake hands.
4698  
4699  "Ah, Michu," the Italian said as they came up to him; "I hope you were
4700  pleased with the temples."
4701  
4702  "Much," Taberman assured him. "They are magnificent."
4703  
4704  Seeing his companion fee the man, he in turn slipped a coin into the
4705  brown hand. His conscience gave him a little twinge at the thought of
4706  plotting to outwit this frank, big creature; but he reflected instantly
4707  that the matter was entirely impersonal, and it was not in a
4708  tariff-hating youth like Jerry to have any scruples over tricking the
4709  Italian government in a matter of this sort.
4710  
4711  "How long would it take you to sail down here from Naples?" asked
4712  Wrenmarsh, as they took the road toward the station.
4713  
4714  Tab considered.
4715  
4716  "Five or six hours with a good breeze," was his conclusion.
4717  
4718  Mr. Wrenmarsh wrinkled his brows and quickened his pace. Those
4719  uncomfortable lines from the nostrils to the corners of his mouth
4720  deepened, and he half shut his eyes. After a little meditation he spoke
4721  again.
4722  
4723  "Very good," he said decisively. "This is the way we'll put the thing
4724  through. You go back to Naples now. Be off the shore here by eleven
4725  o'clock, and send a boat ashore for me and my boxes. They're rather big,
4726  and fairly heavy; and they've got to be handled tenderly. I couldn't get
4727  proper means of packing the things, and I've had to take what there was.
4728  Once we get the stuff on board, we must run back so as to be in Naples
4729  by sunrise. Does that suit you?"
4730  
4731  "You seem to be running this cruise," laughed Jerry. "I suppose it's all
4732  right; but there's one thing I must know. There's no chance of getting
4733  the yacht into a scrape, is there?"
4734  
4735  "Oh, no danger whatever."
4736  
4737  "You're sure?" Tab insisted. "It wouldn't be exactly pleasant to get my
4738  friend's boat confiscated, you know, or into any sort of a mess of that
4739  kind."
4740  
4741  "Bosh!" retorted Mr. Wrenmarsh brusquely. "You may make your mind easy.
4742  The worst that could happen is that I might lose my things. But we must
4743  walk a bit faster, if you're to get your train."
4744  
4745  "It's better to say to-morrow night," Tab remarked, as they took their
4746  way down the road and beneath the old Roman arch. "You see I might be
4747  late in getting back, and"--
4748  
4749  "Of course, of course," interrupted the collector. "You can't count on
4750  getting here to-night. To-morrow night, of course."
4751  
4752  At the station the _capo_ was standing almost where Jerry had left him,
4753  looking at the hills. When the two came up, he merely turned his head
4754  and nodded.
4755  
4756  "The _facchino_ must be doing ticket-duty," the collector remarked.
4757  "We'll go in and get your ticket."
4758  
4759  A tall, yellow, broken-looking man was behind the little wicket in the
4760  ticket-office, puttering with some sort of repair work on a shelf. Mr.
4761  Wrenmarsh addressed him in Italian. The man took a blue and green ticket
4762  from a pigeon-hole on the wall, placed it under the stamp, on the knob
4763  of which he then brought down his fist with a nervous bang. Instantly he
4764  broke out into a violent exclamation.
4765  
4766  "_Sacro sangue della Madonna!_" he shouted, and began to rave
4767  hysterically.
4768  
4769  "What's the matter?" asked Taberman. "What is he saying?"
4770  
4771  "He is cursing quite well," returned the archæologist coolly. "His hand
4772  was unsteady, and he's broken the stamp. He wants to know what will
4773  become of him when the _capo_ finds the punch is broken."
4774  
4775  "Is he tight?" inquired Jerry inelegantly.
4776  
4777  "Oh, he's only bally-rotten with malaria. Look at his face."
4778  
4779  "Tell him he ought to take some quinine," suggested Taberman, genuinely
4780  sorry for the wretched-looking fellow.
4781  
4782  Mr. Wrenmarsh interpreted, but the Italian replied in a tone of mingled
4783  despair and contempt, and went out to show the broken punch to his
4784  superior.
4785  
4786  "What does he say?" asked Jerry.
4787  
4788  "Says he took twenty-four grains this noon," answered Wrenmarsh,
4789  chuckling as if it were funny.
4790  
4791  "Gad!" exclaimed Tab. "No wonder his hand shook. What a country!"
4792  
4793  "You say that?" returned the other. "You may remember that I'm tied to
4794  it till I can get my things out."
4795  
4796  They went out to the platform, and at the moment the train came in.
4797  Jerry took his seat in an empty compartment, and the collector stood
4798  outside the window.
4799  
4800  "You'll surely come?" asked Mr. Wrenmarsh, in a voice almost
4801  threatening.
4802  
4803  "I can't see that I should," Taberman returned; "but wind and weather
4804  permitting, I suppose I shall."
4805  
4806  "I can't attempt to argue with you here," the other said; "but
4807  mind--you'll come."
4808  
4809  "_Pronto! Pronto!_" called the guard in his hoarse sing-song.
4810  
4811  "I shall come," Jerry said reassuringly. "You may bet on it."
4812  
4813  "_Partenza! Partenza!_" the guard bawled, blowing his horn.
4814  
4815  "Good-by. Don't miss it!" cried Wrenmarsh, giving Jerry's hand a
4816  farewell grip.
4817  
4818  "To-morrow night," returned Taberman.
4819  
4820  "I show a light," the collector vociferated, running along the platform
4821  beside the now moving train, and repeating the details he had already
4822  arranged. "A white light."
4823  
4824  "Right-o!" shouted Taberman, as the train bore him beyond the reach of
4825  further communication.
4826  
4827  He threw himself back into the corner of the compartment, and all the
4828  way to Naples he kept wondering over and over what there was about Mr.
4829  Wrenmarsh that had induced him to promise to have a share in a scheme so
4830  mad.

4837  Chapter Eleven
4838  
4839  A LONE-HAND GAME
4840  
4841  
4842  On the morning after his return Jerry rose at an hour comfortably late,
4843  took a swim, shaved, and having finished his breakfast, sat down to
4844  write a short note to Jack. As the captain might put in an appearance at
4845  any moment now, Taberman did not wish to go away from Naples without
4846  leaving some explanation and a hint as to his whereabouts. He found the
4847  letter somewhat difficult to write, since to give Jack a satisfactory
4848  reason for his errand to Pæstum, especially in brief space, was no easy
4849  task. He had been more or less troubled ever since his preposterous
4850  promise to Mr. Wrenmarsh; but now that he was confronted with the
4851  difficulty of making his course appear rational to Jack, he felt himself
4852  so completely a fool that he groaned as he wrote, and then tore up the
4853  note, with a curse. On the whole, he decided to say no more than that he
4854  had gone to take a short run down the coast, as he was bored at Naples.
4855  
4856  He went ashore with the note himself, and leaving the cutter at the
4857  quay to wait for him, he set out on foot for the Hôtel du Vesuve, where
4858  Jack was to report on his arrival. The morning was already well
4859  advanced, and the heat was becoming fervent; but Jerry, freshened by his
4860  recent swim, went blithely on his way. At the hotel he said to the
4861  porter that he wished to leave a letter for a gentleman who was soon to
4862  arrive, and produced his note. The official glanced at the
4863  superscription, and observed that the traveler was already there.
4864  
4865  Jerry stared at him dumfounded.
4866  
4867  "Arrived?" he gasped. "When?"
4868  
4869  "He came on the night train from Rome," replied the porter, whose
4870  English was almost as good as that of Taberman. "He came on the train
4871  that gets in at half-past eight in the morning. He is escorting two
4872  ladies. They are now at breakfast."
4873  
4874  Tab stood for a moment plunged in perplexity. This unexpected arrival of
4875  Jack made his scheme of aiding Wrenmarsh dreadfully difficult, and
4876  perhaps even impossible. He felt himself pledged, however, and he
4877  reflected that whatever were Jack's plans the captain would hardly
4878  hinder him from keeping a promise which he had made on the strength of
4879  the supposition that the Merle was to be in his hands a full month. Jack
4880  had come back before his time, but Tab said to himself that this would
4881  surely make no difference in his fulfilling his obligations to the
4882  archæologist.
4883  
4884  He asked for the breakfast party, and was shown into the carefully
4885  shaded dining-room where they were seated. Hearty greetings followed,
4886  and he sat and talked with them while they finished their repast.
4887  
4888  All three looked a bit fagged. Even Mrs. Fairhew, accustomed as she was
4889  to European travel of all sorts, had dark circles under her keen eyes.
4890  She was dressed, not according to her wont in black, but in a soft gray
4891  which well set off her brilliant complexion, so that in spite of the
4892  look of fatigue she appeared much as she had when the travelers had met
4893  at Nice. Jack was clad in a suit of white linen, with a collarless
4894  jacket such as is worn by naval officers in hot climates. His hair had
4895  been recently cut, and in such a manner as to cause each separate spike
4896  along the parting to stand up in stiff defiance. Jerry politely told him
4897  he looked more like a criminal than usual, but Miss Marchfield protested
4898  rather indignantly. In Katrine Jerry seemed to detect more alteration
4899  than in the others. Her air had grown more sedate, as if the widening
4900  of her mental horizon had, even in these few weeks, given her a new
4901  maturity and self-poise. The heat had perhaps told on her more than on
4902  the others, but in spite of some appearance of fatigue she had an air of
4903  joyous alertness which showed her buoyant and happy.
4904  
4905  "How is it that you are here so soon?" Taberman asked, after a minute of
4906  general talk. "I thought you'd be late, if anything."
4907  
4908  "There was a good deal of sickness at Rome," Jack answered, "and when a
4909  man died of typhoid fever in the very hotel we were at, it seemed time
4910  to move on."
4911  
4912  Mrs. Fairhew gave a little shudder.
4913  
4914  "Only fancy," she said,--"we knew nothing about it until he had been
4915  dead an hour. They told us after breakfast yesterday morning. It was
4916  rather unpleasant, you'll grant."
4917  
4918  "It must have been ghastly," agreed Tab, "but I hope you'll do better in
4919  Naples. It has at least the advantage of being on the sea."
4920  
4921  "And of being one of the dirtiest places in Italy," she responded
4922  grimly. "However, I'm not one to borrow trouble, and we'll trust in the
4923  sea air."
4924  
4925  "You're really becoming amphibious, Mr. Taberman," Katrine observed,
4926  with a smile. "I half fancy that if you were blindfolded you could
4927  smell your way to the water like a turtle."
4928  
4929  "The man that piloted the Merle from North Haven to the Island said he
4930  went by smell," responded Jerry.
4931  
4932  He caught Jack's eye as he spoke, and cast down his glance in confusion.
4933  Mrs. Fairhew regarded him curiously.
4934  
4935  "How did Mr. Drake like that sort of a pilot?" she asked.
4936  
4937  "He didn't hear the remark," Jack put in hastily. "Uncle Randolph
4938  wouldn't have approved of that sort of work, I rather fancy."
4939  
4940  Jerry made a grimace, and echoed the sentiment, but he added that Dave
4941  was really an excellent sailor, and that personally he'd trust the
4942  fellow's sense of smell sooner than he would the skill of most pilots.
4943  The dangerous moment passed without further allusion to the President,
4944  and the talk turned to other matters.
4945  
4946  "Is there any one here we know?" inquired Mrs. Fairhew. "I suppose it is
4947  hardly possible at this time of year."
4948  
4949  "I don't believe there is," answered Tab, "unless," he added, a sudden
4950  thought striking him, "you know where Pæstum is?"
4951  
4952  "Certainly. I've been looking forward with dread to dragging Katrine
4953  down there to see the temples, though really the time of year ought to
4954  excuse us."
4955  
4956  "Well, there's a sort of Anglo-American lunatic archæologist down there,
4957  named Wrenmarsh. Have you ever heard of him? He has relatives in Boston,
4958  I understood him."
4959  
4960  Mrs. Fairhew set down the coffee-cup she was just raising to her lips,
4961  and looked at Jerry with a keen glance in which amusement and surprise
4962  seemed to be mingled.
4963  
4964  "What is his Christian name?" she asked.
4965  
4966  "Gordon."
4967  
4968  "Gordon Wrenmarsh at Pæstum! Well, the world is small, and he might be
4969  anywhere,--at least anywhere where he was not expected to be. Did you
4970  never hear of him? But no, you wouldn't; you're too young. He is one of
4971  my contemporaries, and he has been on this side of the water for ever so
4972  long."
4973  
4974  "Is it possible?" Jerry cried gallantly. "I shouldn't have suspected
4975  that he was so young!"
4976  
4977  "Nobody can mistake you when you wish to pay a compliment," she said,
4978  with a smile that had in it a tinge of satire. "But did you really see
4979  Gordon Wrenmarsh? I haven't heard of him for years. What is he doing? At
4980  one time he was a friend of Mr. Fairhew; they were in the same class at
4981  Harvard."
4982  
4983  She showed a genuine interest, Jerry thought; and at any rate this
4984  seemed to him a good time to prepare Jack for the plan evolved between
4985  him and the archæologist, so he launched forth on the narrative of his
4986  visit to Pæstum. He did not particularize, but he did not hesitate to
4987  say that the archæologist had chanced upon a rich find which he was
4988  guarding in the hope of running it safely out of the country.
4989  
4990  "Why shouldn't he take it out of the country if he's bought it?" Katrine
4991  asked, with an air of interest.
4992  
4993  "The Italian law says he shan't," Jack answered, with a smile.
4994  
4995  "Why, if it's his, he has a right to do what he pleases, I should
4996  think," she responded.
4997  
4998  "But there's a law against carrying works of art out of the country."
4999  
5000  "What a horrid, unjust law!" she protested. "If they were mine, I'd take
5001  them out; you may be sure of that."
5002  
5003  "I'd help you," Jack assured her lightly.
5004  
5005  Jerry was secretly so pleased at this passage that he endeavored to keep
5006  the conversation in the same line by inquiring of Mrs. Fairhew further
5007  particulars about the strange creature with whom he had made tryst.
5008  
5009  "Was Mr. Wrenmarsh always as peculiar as he is now?" he asked.
5010  
5011  "I'm not able to tell you that," she returned, "as I have no means of
5012  knowing how much he has changed; but when I knew him he was the most
5013  extraordinary creature. He was always offended if people didn't notice
5014  his eccentricities, and if they did he jibed at their provincialism. He
5015  said he had to become an Englishman because our civilization was so
5016  crude, and he never forgave Bostonians for being so little concerned by
5017  his change of nationality."
5018  
5019  "You seem to have picked up rather a choice acquaintance, Jerry,"
5020  observed Jack good-naturedly.
5021  
5022  "Oh, Mr. Wrenmarsh became utterly impossible," Mrs. Fairhew continued.
5023  "He really had a lot of ability, and I'm told that now he's done some
5024  remarkable things in getting antiques for the British Museum. His own
5025  people couldn't get on with him at all."
5026  
5027  "What an extraordinary creature he must be!" commented Katrine. "Did you
5028  take him for a wild man, Mr. Taberman, when you found him wandering
5029  about among the ruins of Pæstum?"
5030  
5031  "No," Jerry returned, rather regretting that he had continued the talk
5032  about Mr. Wrenmarsh. "He came into the little hovel of an inn there
5033  while I was trying to get something to eat."
5034  
5035  "Well, anyway I hope he'll get his things safe," she added. "They're
5036  his, and the government has no right to interfere with him."
5037  
5038  "I hope he may," Tab responded rather dispiritedly.
5039  
5040  Breakfast being ended, the ladies betook themselves to their rooms to
5041  rest after the fatigues of their night of travel.
5042  
5043  "If I were a billionaire," Mrs. Fairhew observed, "I would never go
5044  anywhere by night except on my own private car. All sleepers are an
5045  abomination, and I hate the thought of who may have been in the
5046  compartment when I have to sleep in it. I hope we shall see you at
5047  dinner, Mr. Taberman?"
5048  
5049  "Thank you," Jerry answered, "but I have business to-night. I assure you
5050  I regret it tremendously."
5051  
5052  "Well," the lady returned over her shoulder as she departed, "at least
5053  we shall expect to see you to-morrow; and I hope you'll leave us Mr.
5054  Castleport.
5055  
5056  "Glad to," laughed Jerry, with a nod; and the men were left to
5057  themselves.
5058  
5059  Jerry turned quickly to Jack the moment they were alone, with a look of
5060  earnestness and concern in his face.
5061  
5062  "Cap'n," he said urgently, "come somewhere where we can talk, will you?
5063  We've got heaps to say, and my time's precious."
5064  
5065  "Jerry," cried the other, catching him by the arm, "something has
5066  happened to the Merle!"
5067  
5068  "Not a thing, Jacko. She is as right as a trivet, but I'm in a hurry.
5069  Come on!"
5070  
5071  "Hurry?" echoed Jack, following him in evident disquiet; "what in the
5072  world's up? It can't be mutiny, and if the yacht's all right, I don't
5073  see"--
5074  
5075  "I'll explain," Taberman responded. "I know a jolly little place just
5076  round the corner. Come on."
5077  
5078  Jack suffered himself to be led to a small café which bore the rather
5079  incongruously ambitious name _Albergo del Sole_, and which displayed on
5080  the yellowish wall above its entrance a rising sun, blood-red and most
5081  magnificent as to its rays. At one of the little tables which covered
5082  the sidewalk before this establishment, the pair took their places. Tab
5083  produced his cigarette-case and ordered a glass of vermouth as he
5084  offered his friend a smoke. Jack, with a hardly perceptible compression
5085  of the lips which showed that he was controlling his impatience and
5086  waiting for Tab to speak, rolled his cigarette between his thumb and
5087  forefinger to loosen it, tapped it on the table-top, and lighted it with
5088  great deliberation. Jerry did the same, but with evident nervousness.
5089  
5090  "Jack," said he, "I have been, and gone, and done it, for fair!"
5091  
5092  "What?" inquired Jack in a tone mildly incisive.
5093  
5094  "Well, you see--it's this way," Tab answered. "Of course I haven't
5095  really done anything yet, but I think I'm bound to, and if you don't
5096  think so--Well, you can see it'll be devilish hard on me as well as
5097  him."
5098  
5099  Jack blew a smoke-ring, and looked at Jerry with a queer smile.
5100  
5101  "It must be something pretty bad, Jerry," he said, "if you don't dare
5102  tell me what it is."
5103  
5104  Jerry looked at him a minute, and then broke into a grin.
5105  
5106  "Why," he said, more at his ease, "it's that damned archæologist, that
5107  bedlamite Wrenmarsh I was talking about at the hotel. Well, not having
5108  anything else to do, I went down to Pæstum to see the temples and kill
5109  time, and I fell into his clutches. I had a lot of talk with him, or he
5110  did with me. He knows a pile about the temples, and he did the showman
5111  in great shape. Incidentally he told me all about his own affairs. I
5112  didn't ask him, mind you. He just did it off his own bat. I couldn't
5113  help that, now could I?"
5114  
5115  "I don't see how you could," Jack assented; "and no more do I see why
5116  you should want to."
5117  
5118  "Why, a chap down there--a Dago peasant, you know--has turned up a
5119  dreadful mess of stuff Wrenmarsh has bought. I told you all that at
5120  breakfast."
5121  
5122  "Yes," Jack said imperturbably.
5123  
5124  "You see, Wrenmarsh turned to and bought the whole slithering lot of it,
5125  and he's just crazy over it; but as I said at the hotel, he's up against
5126  the government, and he doesn't know how under the heavens he's going to
5127  get the loot out of Italy."
5128  
5129  "Great Scott, Tab, did you undertake to run his things out of the
5130  country for him? In the Merle, too?" cried Jack, at last showing some
5131  consternation.
5132  
5133  "It's not quite so bad as that," Jerry protested; "but I did tell him
5134  I'd help him out of Pæstum and up here. Naples is all I agreed to.
5135  That's all he asked."
5136  
5137  Castleport smoked in silence a moment, looking decidedly grave.
5138  
5139  "Jack, old man," Jerry said pleadingly, "I've been an awful ass, but the
5140  way that beastly Wrenmarsh snarled me up with his talk was perfectly
5141  inconceivable. He'd have talked the tail off a brass monkey. He kept
5142  appealing to my sense of honor and heaven knows what, until I felt that
5143  I'd be a perfect cad not to help him."
5144  
5145  "That's all right, Tab," Jack answered thoughtfully. "It's only the
5146  Merle--I should hate awfully to get her into a mess."
5147  
5148  "He assured me that nothing could happen to her, and I don't think he'd
5149  lie."
5150  
5151  "Well, if that's so, there's no great harm done, old man. What are you
5152  worrying over?"
5153  
5154  "I'm not worrying at all, Jacko, if you don't object to my keeping my
5155  word. Just continue my letters of marque until to-morrow. I promised him
5156  I'd go down this afternoon. You will be in command, of course, now
5157  you're here; but I'd hate to think of the poor wretch waiting down there
5158  in the marshes for me--it's an awful place for malaria!--and I not
5159  coming at all."
5160  
5161  "Oh, I shan't interfere," Jack said quickly. "I had made up my mind to
5162  stay on shore one night more anyway, and I really gave you the yacht
5163  till the twentieth. You shall run this thing yourself; but, by Jove, to
5164  think of Uncle Randolph's Merle in business like that!"
5165  
5166  "We started out to be pirates anyway," laughed Jerry, "and we haven't
5167  lived up to our reputation so far. Well, I'll try it. I shall be rid of
5168  the beggar by ten o'clock to-morrow, wind and weather permitting. It's
5169  awful good of you, old man. I thought you'd think I was a bally-ass to
5170  let myself be bamboozled that way; but when he was talking to me I felt
5171  as if he was being awfully bully-ragged, and I ought to help him out."
5172  
5173  "Of course," was Jack's response. "Didn't you notice how Katrine had
5174  exactly the same feeling, just from your telling about it?"
5175  
5176  Tab felt like winking to himself, but he preserved a grave countenance,
5177  and only asked,--
5178  
5179  "What will you tell Mrs. Fairhew about the Merle's being away?"
5180  
5181  "Oh, that 's simple enough. I'll tell her you wanted to visit Pæstum
5182  again, and you can say afterward that you ran across Wrenmarsh and
5183  brought him up to Naples. Twig it?"
5184  
5185  "Clear as a bell. Come down and see me off."
5186  
5187  He sprang from his chair with animation, greatly relieved that the
5188  captain had not prevented him from carrying out his plan. As Jack rose
5189  also, Jerry laid his hand affectionately on his shoulder.
5190  
5191  "It's awfully good of you, old man," he said.
5192  
5193  "Nonsense. It's a mighty little thing to do for you, when you came
5194  across the Atlantic for me."
5195  
5196  "Oh, rats!" Tab rejoined inelegantly. "I came for the fun of it."
5197  
5198  They paid the reckoning, and made their way to the quay, where for an
5199  hour and a half the boat had been waiting for Jerry. The men were
5200  lolling about in the stray corners of shade available, smoking and
5201  sleepily exchanging occasional remarks; but at the sight of the captain
5202  they woke up at once.
5203  
5204  "Here's the skipper," cried one, jumping to his feet and saluting.
5205  
5206  The others followed his example with alacrity, and Jack could not but be
5207  gratified by the unmistakable pleasure they showed at seeing him again.
5208  
5209  "How are you, boys?" he said cheerily. "Glad to see you all. You seem to
5210  be in fighting trim, the whole lot of you."
5211  
5212  "We're bang up, sir," responded Dave, with a grin. "'Tain't the kind o'
5213  weather we left home in, sir."
5214  
5215  "Not exactly," Jack responded laughingly, as he took his place in the
5216  stern-sheets; "but I hope you don't miss the fog too much. Oars!"
5217  
5218  Jack stayed on the Merle for an hour and a half, reading the log and
5219  exchanging with Jerry all the news that either could rake up. Gonzague
5220  made errands into the cabin evidently for the purpose of feasting his
5221  eyes on his master, and beamed with delight at every word Castleport
5222  spoke to him. When the old man found that the captain had not come to
5223  remain, he looked so doleful that Castleport rallied him about not
5224  liking Tab as a skipper.
5225  
5226  "Eet ees not dat," Gonzague responded, with eloquent hands and
5227  shoulders; "he ees fine as de seelk, but--but Mistaire Taberman he ees
5228  not zee capataine you."
5229  
5230  Jerry was anxious to make an early start for Pæstum, as the wind was
5231  light, so Jack took his leave with hearty wishes for a prosperous run.
5232  Jerry went with him to the steps.
5233  
5234  "By the way, Jack," he asked in an undertone, as the captain was about
5235  to descend to take his place in the cutter, "are congratulations in
5236  order?"
5237  
5238  Castleport looked away from his friend toward where, across the bay, in
5239  a dim haze of purple, stood Capri. Then he glanced quickly into Jerry's
5240  eyes.
5241  
5242  "I--I haven't said anything to her," he answered simply.
5243  
5244  He ran down the steps to the cutter. Gonzague himself had taken the
5245  boat-hook to hold the craft steady. Castleport put his hand kindly on
5246  the old man's shoulder.
5247  
5248  "Good-by, Gonzague," he said. "I'm coming aboard for keeps to-morrow.
5249  Good-by, Jerry."
5250  
5251  "Good-by, and--good luck," called Tab in reply, as the cutter started
5252  away.
5253  
5254  
5255  It lacked a quarter of an hour to twelve that night when the Merle hove
5256  to a cable's length off Pæstum. The wind had freshened at sundown, and
5257  was blowing a smart breeze from the west. Jerry had the cutter lowered,
5258  and, leaving Gonzague in charge, with stringent orders to keep the yacht
5259  lying where she was, had himself pulled toward the shore. The men had no
5260  notion what was going on, but they obeyed orders with a prompt alacrity
5261  which showed that they felt that something of unusual import was in this
5262  business. When the cutter was within about a hundred feet of the shore,
5263  Tab ordered the men to lie on their oars, and keep watch for a light. In
5264  silence and utter darkness, for though the stars were shining there was
5265  no moon, they tossed about in the black troughs of the sea for twenty
5266  minutes. Then Dave uttered a guarded exclamation.
5267  
5268  "There's a light, sir," he said. "See, there it is again."
5269  
5270  "Lay her head for it, and pull!" commanded Jerry, feeling as if he were
5271  in a pirate novel. "No noise, mind!"
5272  
5273  The light had appeared for an instant some two or three hundred feet up
5274  the shore from the point off which the cutter lay rolling. They pulled
5275  quietly for the spot, the oars sounding softly, the water lapping the
5276  bows of the boat, and the wind bringing to their ears the muffled rote
5277  as of a sand beach.
5278  
5279  "Let her run," ordered Tab in an undertone. "Can you see the light?"
5280  
5281  For a minute they rolled in darkness as before, and then again sighted
5282  the signal, this time straight in shore. Jerry felt his heart beat as he
5283  gave the order to run in, and a consciousness of romantic adventure,
5284  lawless and wild, was like a sweet and exhilarating flavor in his mouth.
5285  Such a deed on his native shores would have had an atmosphere of secret
5286  villany about it, but here, in alien waters, on a foreign coast, under
5287  the darkness of night, the romantic side was intensified a
5288  thousand-fold. A whimsical feeling flitted through the back of his head
5289  that he ought to be dressed differently for such an occasion; that he
5290  should have had a shaggy black beard, a red sash stuck full of pistols,
5291  and half a dozen cutlasses disposed promiscuously about his person. He
5292  was not without a fleeting consciousness that some time he might at
5293  home, to the old crowd of college boys, find a keen joy in telling of
5294  this night, and--But the light flashed out again, this time so near that
5295  the cutter lay full in the middle of the dark, fire-sprinkled path it
5296  illumined; and Jerry's entire mind was called back to the business in
5297  hand. He could in the light see the cheeks of the men in front of him as
5298  they swayed with their rowing, the brass rowlocks of the cutter, and the
5299  dripping blades of the oars. He strained his eyes toward the land, but
5300  was blinded by the glare into which he looked; and on the instant a
5301  voice, eager but subdued, hailed from the shore some twenty feet away.
5302  
5303  "Hallo! Are you there, Mr. Taberman?"
5304  
5305  "Here all right," answered Jerry. "Eyes in the boat!" he added sharply
5306  to the men, every one of whom except Dave had turned to look ashore.
5307  "Three good strokes now: Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!... Let her run!"
5308  
5309  The nose of the cutter ground on a sand-beach; the bowsman sprang ashore
5310  with the painter and held her, while Jerry clambered forward, steadying
5311  himself with a hand on the shoulder of the rowers. On leaping to the
5312  land, he was confronted by Mr. Wrenmarsh. That gentleman shifted the
5313  lantern he held from his right hand to his left, and shook hands with
5314  Taberman fervently.
5315  
5316  "You're just in time," he said hurriedly. "We haven't a second to lose.
5317  The boxes are right here on the edge of the grass. Come on with your
5318  men. It'll take four of them for that biggest box."
5319  
5320  Jerry called the four men who were nearest, and telling the rest to
5321  stand by, he hurried up the beach. In the sand, by the light of the
5322  lantern with which the archæologist came after him, he saw the print of
5323  wheels leading up to a pile of rude wooden cases. Three of them were of
5324  moderate size, but the fourth looked to Tab huge in the semi-darkness.
5325  
5326  "How big is that thing?" he asked, touching it with his foot.
5327  
5328  "Don't kick it!" Wrenmarsh responded quickly and sharply. "It's only
5329  about a metre square and half as deep. I couldn't make it any smaller."
5330  
5331  Jerry whistled with dismay.
5332  
5333  "We may lose it overboard on the way to the Merle," he remarked cruelly.
5334  Then without heeding the dismayed exclamation of the collector, he
5335  ordered the men to take that first. "Put it as far astern as you can,"
5336  he said. "I'm afraid you'll have to wade in with it."
5337  
5338  "For God's sake hurry," cried Wrenmarsh. "I know that beastly carter has
5339  put the custodi up to the job by this time. Only don't drop that case!"
5340  he added, running along by the side of the bearers with the lantern
5341  swinging wildly to and fro and bumping against his legs.
5342  
5343  The case was evidently pretty heavy, and the men breathed deep as they
5344  carried it across the loose sand. By dint of the men's wading in beside
5345  the cutter the big box was safely deposited in the stern-sheets, and the
5346  sailors went back for a new load. A second box was stowed without
5347  trouble, but as the two others, which were fortunately the smallest,
5348  were being lifted by two men each, Wrenmarsh clutched Taberman by the
5349  arm.
5350  
5351  "Look there!" he cried. "Look there! Quick, men! For God's sake, quick!"
5352  
5353  Not more than a hundred yards away on the beach to the southward was an
5354  advancing lantern. Suddenly it stopped.
5355  
5356  "What is it?" asked Tab.
5357  
5358  The men, spurred on by Wrenmarsh, were fairly running across the sand,
5359  and Tab skurried along with them toward the boat.
5360  
5361  "Hurry! Hurry!" was the breathless response of Wrenmarsh. "It's the
5362  custodi and the police--those cursed _carabinieri_! I told you the
5363  carter'd sell me out."
5364  
5365  It was only a minute before the men had reached the boat, and hurriedly
5366  stowed the boxes they carried. Taberman and Wrenmarsh scrambled in, and
5367  Jerry, sitting in a distorted and cramped position behind the big box,
5368  got hold of the lines. The men pushed off, and got into their places
5369  anyhow. Just as Tab opened his lips to order the men to give way, a
5370  peremptory voice came to them from the shore to the south. The light had
5371  not advanced from where they had seen it stop, but it had gone waving
5372  wildly up and down the beach as if the bearers had encountered some
5373  impassable obstacle and sought in vain for a place which would allow a
5374  passage.
5375  
5376  "_Aspetta!_" bawled the voice. "_Aspetta nel nomme del Re!_"
5377  
5378  "What's that?" asked Jerry.
5379  
5380  "They're calling us to stand--in the king's name," Mr. Wrenmarsh
5381  returned with sullen nervousness.
5382  
5383  "Head the boat 'round," cried Tab. "Why the devil don't they come down
5384  if they want us?"
5385  
5386  "I can't imagine," the collector answered.
5387  
5388  "Perhaps they're afraid of us; but I don't think that can be it."
5389  
5390  "_Aspetta!_" thundered the voice on shore more savagely. "_Aspetta o
5391  tiriamo!_"
5392  
5393  "By Jove! The sands!" cried Wrenmarsh. "There's a brook there--the
5394  bottom's quicksand. They daren't try to cross."
5395  
5396  "Quicksand?" echoed Tab. "How'd they come there, then?"
5397  
5398  "They must have thought we were on the other side of the stream. They've
5399  come up on the wrong bank, and now they can't get over."
5400  
5401  Bang! There was a quick, loud report, and Jerry heard the _wht_ of a
5402  carbine ball close astern.
5403  
5404  "Great Scott!" he shouted. "Douse that glim! Pull! Pull!"
5405  
5406  Wrenmarsh seized the lantern and dipped it overboard, an effective if
5407  irregular way of quenching it.
5408  
5409  Bang! Bang! Two more shots. One of the men, Hunter, pulling on the third
5410  thwart, afterward swore that he felt the wind of the second bullet.
5411  
5412  Bang!
5413  
5414  "Pull hard, men! Steady!" cried Jerry.
5415  
5416  A man of race and training, while in a crisis of this sort he feels more
5417  excitement than his thicker-skinned fellows, displays more outward
5418  coolness. Social development means the power of self-control, especially
5419  when any sense of responsibility is involved. Taberman was inwardly wild
5420  with the stirring emotions of an experience such as he not only had
5421  never encountered but of which he had heard in a hundred ways which lent
5422  associations to heighten the effect; yet he did not lose for a moment
5423  his sense of having the men to care for. He kept his head, and called
5424  the stroke for the rowers. They showed by their tendency to pull wildly
5425  how near they were to demoralization, and Jerry urged them to steadiness
5426  with language of the most picturesque emphasis.
5427  
5428  Bang! Bang! Bang! Three shots. At the third there was a sharp rap, as if
5429  the cutter had been hit by a pebble, and a queer little squeak of
5430  splintering wood. Tab started up, but instantly sat down again, catching
5431  at the yoke-line he had half let fall.
5432  
5433  "Close call," Wrenmarsh said nervously.
5434  
5435  "Yes," Jerry answered laconically. "Stroke! Stroke! Steady!"
5436  
5437  At the instant he had heard the sound of the ball on the wood of the
5438  boat, he had felt a sharp twinge in his left arm, as if the muscle had
5439  been suddenly tweaked off the bone by a pair of white-hot pincers. The
5440  pain was exquisite, but he forced himself to keep calm, and beyond the
5441  first involuntary spring he gave no indication that he had been hit. In
5442  a sort of double consciousness he kept saying to himself that he
5443  wondered how severe the hurt was, and at the same time he seemed to be
5444  lifted by sheer will and excitement above even the physical feeling of
5445  the moment.
5446  
5447  "Steady!" he said, and was queerly conscious of a sort of exultation
5448  that his voice was so strong and natural. "We're 'most out of range."
5449  
5450  Other shots followed, but they splashed harmlessly astern. The darkness
5451  was a shelter, and although the carbines flashed again and again from
5452  the shore, no more damage was done on board the cutter. Ahead of them
5453  Tab, holding himself together grimly, saw the red and green
5454  sailing-lights of the Merle, and realized that at the sound of the
5455  firing Gonzague must have run the yacht in shore.
5456  
5457  "Ahoy!" Jerry called.
5458  
5459  Tears of pain suffused his eyes in spite of him, and made the colored
5460  lights big and blurry, as if they were the glaring orbs of some huge
5461  dragon.
5462  
5463  "Hollá!" came Gonzague's voice. "A'right, sair!" and with a deafening
5464  boom of canvas the schooner luffed up.
5465  
5466  Jerry put his right arm behind him, his left hanging limply, and
5467  getting hold of the rudder-yoke he laid the cutter alongside the yacht.
5468  He and Wrenmarsh got up to the deck, a davit was turned out-board as a
5469  crane and the boxes hoisted, and then the boat slung up.
5470  
5471  Faint and savage with pain, Jerry still fought with himself to keep up,
5472  and to fulfill his duties as commander. He remembered that his order for
5473  the Merle to lie to where she was had been disregarded; and though he
5474  was inwardly glad that the yacht had been brought to meet the cutter, he
5475  felt that discipline was discipline, and he was in no mood to let any
5476  infringement of orders go unnoted. He called Gonzague.
5477  
5478  "What's the meaning of this?" he demanded fiercely. "Didn't I give
5479  orders to keep the yacht hove to till I came out?"
5480  
5481  "Yes, sair," Gonzague answered contritely, stroking his stiff white
5482  mustache with nervous fingers, "bot I heer de shotin' ashore, an'"--
5483  
5484  "That made no difference. I'm ashamed that an old seaman like you should
5485  disobey orders simply because he heard a row ashore. Go forward. I shall
5486  mark you in the log."
5487  
5488  The old man took himself off without a word. However much he was likely
5489  to feel the sting of this reproof, he was not the man to fail to
5490  respect the mate for it, and of this Tab might be assured when he had
5491  the calmness to think things over.
5492  
5493  Jerry gave the helmsman the course for Naples, and the Merle swung off
5494  on her return. Then he started to go below, but now that the need of
5495  immediate action was over he suddenly turned sick and dizzy. He put out
5496  his uninjured arm with a quick clutch at Mr. Wrenmarsh.
5497  
5498  "Give me--your arm," he said weakly. "I'm--I'm hit, you know, and things
5499  go round."
5500  
5501  "Hit!" echoed the collector. "Where? Is it serious?"
5502  
5503  "Arm," answered Jerry. "Help me get below."
5504  
5505  The archæologist supported Jerry to the companion, and then almost
5506  carried him down the steps. He tried to place him on the transom, but
5507  Taberman stubbornly walked half the length of the cabin, and sank into a
5508  chair by the table. His lips seemed to him queerly stiff as he twisted
5509  them into a wry smile.
5510  
5511  "Mustn't bleed on the cushions, y' know," he said feebly. "Call
5512  Gonzague."
5513  
5514  Wrenmarsh shouted the name explosively, hovering solicitously over
5515  Jerry, and in a moment the Provençal appeared. Jerry made a mighty
5516  effort to pull himself together.
5517  
5518  "Here, Gonzague," he said, "get the medicine-chest, and strip my coat
5519  off. I've got to be fixed. I want some hot water and a b. and s. Beg
5520  your--pardon," he added, turning slowly to Mr. Wrenmarsh, and confusedly
5521  wishing that the cabin would not turn so much faster than he could. "I'm
5522  forgetting. This gentleman's to have Jack's--the captain's stateroom.
5523  Will you have anything to drink? 'Fraid I'm poor host, but"--
5524  
5525  "No, no," cried the archæologist. "That's all right. The brandy,
5526  Gonzague, quick!"
5527  
5528  A brandy and soda put fresh life into Jerry, who still tried to be
5529  polite, and protested that the collector should not bother.
5530  
5531  "You'll find me a first-class chirurgeon," responded the other. "Where's
5532  the medicine-chest, Gonzague?"
5533  
5534  He proved remarkably ready and efficient and kindly withal. He stripped
5535  off Jerry's jacket and cut away the shirt-sleeve, to discover a two-inch
5536  sliver of African oak from the gunwale of the cutter stabbed into a
5537  jagged hole in the forearm. He probed and cut and trimmed with the skill
5538  of a trained surgeon, while Jerry, pale and with set teeth, bore it all
5539  with Spartan firmness until everything was over, and then, as he tried
5540  to rise when the last bandage was in place, fainted dead away.
5541  
5542  When the plucky mate had been brought round and stowed away in his
5543  berth, Gonzague again took charge of the Merle, and dropped her anchor
5544  once more in the harbor of Naples at about eight o'clock in the morning.
5545  
5546  Just before Mr. Wrenmarsh turned in for the night, he put his head into
5547  the door of Jerry's stateroom to ask if he could do anything for him.
5548  
5549  "No, thank you," Jerry returned. "Much obliged; but the man by my door
5550  will hear if I want anything. I'm all right now. I'm jolly much obliged
5551  to you for fixing me up."
5552  
5553  "'Pon my word, Table--Taberman, you're the most extraordinary man for a
5554  Bostonian I ever saw. Good-night."
5555  
5556  "Good-night," Jerry responded. Then he chuckled, and added, "But
5557  Boston's full of better men than I am, if you'd only stayed there to see
5558  'em."

5565  Chapter Twelve
5566  
5567  AT VERGIL'S TOMB
5568  
5569  
5570  "I never could touch it," Katrine said, with an emphatic shake of her
5571  head. "I should think a baby brought up on goat's milk would run round
5572  and bleat. Why, I think the idea of it is horrid!"
5573  
5574  Her eyes sparkled and her whole air was full of a delicious animation,
5575  so that it was no wonder Jack threw back his head and laughed, as much
5576  in sheer admiration as from amusement. He was in high spirits this
5577  morning, the excitement of a mighty resolve stirring in his blood.
5578  
5579  "How do you know that you haven't been having goat's milk at the hotel?"
5580  he demanded. "Aren't you afraid you'll begin to break out in a baa
5581  yourself all of a sudden?"
5582  
5583  "Why, how rude you are!" she cried, her dimples deepening and shoaling.
5584  "Of course they wouldn't dare to give it to us, and we should know it if
5585  they did!"
5586  
5587  The young people were being driven in a Neapolitan _vettura_ to the
5588  tomb of Vergil. Jack had mentioned the spot that morning at breakfast as
5589  being well worth a visit, if only for the view, and said that the ladies
5590  ought to see it. Mrs. Fairhew had, for reasons perhaps not wholly
5591  unconnected with remembrances of her own youth and the late Mr. Fairhew,
5592  declined to make the jaunt, on the score that it was too hot and that
5593  she had a thousand trifles to attend to. She had refused her niece's
5594  prompt offer of assistance, and so left that young woman free to accept
5595  Jack's invitation that she take the drive with him.
5596  
5597  Their talk was light enough, the lighter because Jack at least hardly
5598  dared to venture to be serious lest he betray how terribly in earnest he
5599  was. The sight of a little flock of goats, which had scattered at the
5600  pistol-like crack of their driver's whip, had given them a theme for a
5601  moment. The agile brown animals skipped along the gutters, assailed by
5602  the effervescent profanity of their conductor, a half-naked, slim-limbed
5603  lad browner than the beasts themselves; and with more detonations of the
5604  whiplash the carriage whirled up the hill with hardly diminished speed
5605  as the grade grew steeper. Through picturesque, squalid streets, braver
5606  in their poverty than many a splendid thoroughfare, through nooks that
5607  seemed to be private courtyards with entire families disposed about
5608  them, the carriage took its way noisily; it turned now to the left, now
5609  to the right, continually ascending; it brought them to the top of
5610  narrow ways down which they looked as through a kaleidoscope gleaming
5611  with a confusion of gay colors; it seemed about to land them on the roof
5612  of some building which lay directly before them, and then at the last
5613  moment whisked around some unseen corner and carried them still higher.
5614  
5615  "Isn't it wonderful," Katrine said. "I never saw such a city. I feel
5616  almost as if we were in a flying-machine,--we keep going up so and see
5617  such wonderful sights all the time. Oh, do look down that street! Did
5618  you ever see such colors?"
5619  
5620  "It is stunning," Castleport answered, his eyes on her face.
5621  
5622  "You didn't look at it at all," she said half pouting, as the carriage
5623  whirled them past.
5624  
5625  "Oh, I could see it all in your eyes," he returned. "You don't know what
5626  excellent mirrors they are."
5627  
5628  "What nonsense! How silly you are this morning!"
5629  
5630  Her color deepened, however, and Jack did not feel that his remark had
5631  missed fire. He smiled to himself, and just then the carriage brought
5632  up with a jerk on the left side of the way, in front of a small green
5633  door in a gray retaining-wall. Over the door was printed in black
5634  letters: _Tomba di Virgilio_.
5635  
5636  "Here we are," Jack said.
5637  
5638  He got out with the field-glasses he had brought, and extended his hand
5639  to assist Katrine. She hardly touched his arm with her finger-tips, but
5640  the air was electric, and he felt the thrill like a pulse of warm blood
5641  from head to foot. He did not speak to the driver, but with a manner
5642  that made that piratical Neapolitan regard him with a new respect simply
5643  ordered him in the sign-language of the town to remain in waiting. A
5644  soldier came slouching out of a shop near by wherein he was evidently
5645  lounging, took the prescribed gate-fees, and then opened the narrow
5646  door. This disclosed a staircase, strait and steep, cut from the living
5647  rock, which led upward and to the right.
5648  
5649  They climbed the stone stairs without speaking, but at the top the
5650  wonderful beauty of the view which burst upon them called from Katrine
5651  an involuntary exclamation of surprise and delight. Below them,
5652  red-roofed and multi-colored, Naples lay bathed in the strong white
5653  light of the southern sun; beyond, marvelously blue and ruffled by a
5654  gentle breeze, the waters of the bay flashed and sparkled; and beyond
5655  again, farther yet, stood purple Capri and the piled-up southern shore,
5656  luminous and mistily azure. To the eastward, brooding and tragic, yet
5657  with a thrilling beauty of its own in softly flowing curves and wavering
5658  outline, showed Vesuvius, and stupendous as it was, seemed crouching
5659  sinister and awful, the incarnation of pitiless power.
5660  
5661  Jack focused the glasses, and handed them to Katrine. Then he began to
5662  point here and there, showing her the different things of interest
5663  visible from the spur of the hill on which they were standing. As she
5664  was looking toward the Mole and the New Harbor, suddenly she uttered a
5665  little cry of surprise.
5666  
5667  "There's the Merle," she said. "I'm sure it is. At least she's flying
5668  the American flag."
5669  
5670  "Yes," Jack responded. "That's she, fast enough."
5671  
5672  "Doesn't it seem like a bit of home to see her down there?" Katrine went
5673  on. "I think it was perfectly wonderful that Mr. Drake let you take her
5674  this summer."
5675  
5676  Jack gave a quick movement of the shoulders, and then set his lips
5677  together more firmly.
5678  
5679  "I shall have to tell her the whole thing," he thought to himself. Aloud
5680  he said, "I shouldn't have been here when you were if it hadn't been
5681  for having the Merle."
5682  
5683  "I suppose not," she answered, and the change in her tone showed most
5684  clearly that she understood in the words more than met the ear.
5685  
5686  After they had stood for a time in admiration of the magnificent view
5687  before them, they turned to go to the tomb, twenty yards away. The
5688  uneven path, bordered by beautiful wild poppies and violets, was shaded
5689  by gnarled fig and plum trees. A splendid stone-pine rose superb on the
5690  left, crowned by its dome-shaped cluster of branches.
5691  
5692  "Oh," Katrine cried, "it's perfectly beautiful, isn't it? It makes you
5693  feel solemn, it's so lovely."
5694  
5695  "Yes," he assented, and unwonted emotion left him with no word to add.
5696  
5697  "Just look at those flowers," she went on. "What a pity it is that we
5698  don't have them like that at home."
5699  
5700  "It's a fitting place for Vergil to be buried in, isn't it?" Jack said.
5701  "I thought you would like it."
5702  
5703  "It is a place I shall remember all my life," she replied. Her eyes met
5704  his as she spoke, and her glance fell with quick consciousness. Before
5705  he could speak, she added hurriedly, "Is this the tomb?"
5706  
5707  "Yes," he answered, entirely undisturbed by any chilling scholastic
5708  doubts on the subject, "this is the tomb."
5709  
5710  Before them was a lowly structure of old rubble, four square, and a
5711  narrow door, at which the path, with a sudden dip, came to an end.
5712  
5713  "Will you go in?" he said, standing aside.
5714  
5715  Katrine entered, and he followed. The place was as simple within as
5716  without. The floor seemed to be of beaten earth; the single room, or
5717  _cella_, was lighted by a small window, and it contained only two or
5718  three cinerary urns of dark red clay, which leaned against the wall
5719  opposite the door. Above these, in brown letters on a tablet of white
5720  marble, was an inscription set there by the Academy of France.
5721  
5722  The pair stood silent for a minute, Katrine reading the tablet, and
5723  Jack, his head bared, standing beside her. As she turned her head she
5724  caught for a second time his glance. She colored, and moved quickly to
5725  the small window.
5726  
5727  "Isn't the view wonderful!" she said, as if she had caught at the first
5728  words that came into her mind.
5729  
5730  "Yes," he returned absently. "Fine, isn't it?"
5731  
5732  She looked a moment out of the window, and then, avoiding his eyes, she
5733  turned back to the Latin distich cut in the tablet, and by tradition
5734  assigned to Vergil himself:--
5735  
5736  
5737       Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc
5738       Parthenope. Cecini pascua, rura, duces.
5739  
5740  
5741  "You'll think I am unspeakably stupid," she said, "but I confess I
5742  cannot make it out. 'Mantua gave me birth,' I can read that."
5743  
5744  "'The Calabrian winds carried me away,'" Jack went on.
5745  
5746  "Oh, yes; but I don't understand the Parthenope."
5747  
5748  "That's Naples," he answered. "'Naples holds me.'"
5749  
5750  "Oh, is that it? I know the rest. 'I sang pastures, fields, leaders.'"
5751  
5752  "Good! You shall have an A in the examination in spite of Parthenope,"
5753  he assured her. "Perhaps 'heroes' is a better word for _duces_, though."
5754  
5755  "I'm afraid I don't deserve an A," she laughed, "but I am satisfied if I
5756  pass at all."
5757  
5758  As they came out of the tomb Jack picked a spray from the beautiful
5759  laurel growing beside the entrance, and held it out to her. She took it
5760  with a murmured word of thanks, and put it in her gown. Not far away on
5761  the right of the path was a rude seat or bench, shaded by fig and olive
5762  trees, and partially screened from the path by dwarf plums. It was
5763  slightly higher than the way by which they had come.
5764  
5765  "Here," Jack said, "let's go up and rest a bit. The view is worth
5766  seeing."
5767  
5768  They turned to the seat and took their places in silence. The view was
5769  not perceptibly different from that which they had on the path, but as
5770  Jack looked at Katrine and Katrine cast down her eyes, this was not a
5771  matter which they were likely to notice.
5772  
5773  "Katrine," the captain began,--for they had come, almost by insensible
5774  degrees, to call each other by their Christian names,--"I've got to tell
5775  you something. It isn't altogether pleasant for me, but it's only fair
5776  that you should know."
5777  
5778  She looked up at him in evident surprise and with some disquiet.
5779  
5780  "Why, what is it?" she asked. "I hope it isn't anything really
5781  terrible."
5782  
5783  He hesitated, and began to scrape the ground with his foot nervously.
5784  
5785  "I--er--Well, to be honest, I don't know exactly how to tell you so you
5786  won't be too hard on me," he answered frankly.
5787  
5788  "Is it so bad?" she queried in a tone which showed some concern under
5789  its assumed lightness.
5790  
5791  "What in the world have you been doing? You haven't been murdering
5792  anybody, I hope."
5793  
5794  "What would you say," asked Jack, "what would you think of a man that
5795  acted like this? Suppose a case. Suppose the chap was, in the first
5796  place, in America. Suppose he had a friend, a friend he cared a lot
5797  about, one he thought more of than anybody else in the world, and that
5798  friend was on this side. Suppose the man's property was all tied up,--in
5799  trust, you know,--and he'd promised not to borrow, so he couldn't
5800  honorably raise the money to come over unless his trustee would let him.
5801  The trustee, we'll say, is a nice old fellow,--really nice, you know,
5802  only rather crotchety,--who wouldn't hear a word of the chap's going."
5803  
5804  He stopped as if for encouragement, and Katrine, with evident
5805  appreciation of this, murmured, "Yes, I understand."
5806  
5807  "And suppose," Castleport went on, a new hesitancy coming into his
5808  voice, "that this trustee--of course the chap is his nearest relative,
5809  you know--has an able schooner yacht. Now if the chap simply couldn't
5810  stand it, but captured that yacht--not violently, of course, but by
5811  stratagem,--and came over to see his friend, and to ask her"--
5812  
5813  "Why, Jack Castleport!" cried Katrine, with eyes open to their widest.
5814  "You don't mean that you ran away with the Merle! I never can believe
5815  it!"
5816  
5817  "It's true, though," he responded. "Do you blame me so very much?"
5818  
5819  Her glance dropped before his, and her manner instantly lost its
5820  boldness.
5821  
5822  "I--Why, of course that depends," she murmured.
5823  
5824  "Depends on what?"
5825  
5826  "On--how--how necessary it was for him to see his friend."
5827  
5828  "Oh," Jack cried. "I had to see her! You know I had to come, Katrine! I
5829  had to tell you I love you, and I stole Uncle Randolph's yacht because
5830  he wouldn't let me come any other way. I had to come."
5831  
5832  He sprang up in his excitement, and stood before her, his hands twisting
5833  each other in a way odd enough for one of so much self-control.
5834  
5835  "You must have known how I cared for you, Katrine. I couldn't tell you
5836  without making a clean breast of this, but don't be too hard on me. I
5837  had to come."
5838  
5839  She flashed up at him the merest hair's-breadth of a glance, and with
5840  her hands pressed to her bosom, said softly, "I never could have
5841  forgiven you if you hadn't come."
5842  
5843  He simply stooped over and took her unceremoniously in his arms, and it
5844  was several moments before she had breath and presence of mind to
5845  protest.
5846  
5847  "Heavens!" she cried with mock terror. "Am I in the arms of a pirate?
5848  Jack, I never knew anything so shocking in my life! How could you do
5849  it?"
5850  
5851  "I had to get across the Atlantic to you," he answered, as if that were
5852  an excuse all-sufficient.
5853  
5854  And the sun shone down on the sea and on Vesuvius and on Vergil's tomb,
5855  and on that which is more enduring than all these,--the sweetness of
5856  young love.

5863  Chapter Thirteen
5864  
5865  A BID FOR THE ODD TRICK
5866  
5867  
5868  While the captain was looking with Katrine down on the Merle, as the
5869  yacht lay quietly at anchor in the harbor, a notable conversation was
5870  taking place on board. At no very early hour Tab had risen, tubbed with
5871  difficulty, and, with some aid, got into his clothes. His left arm was
5872  stiff and very sore, but beyond that he felt no discomfort. His
5873  magnificent physique, improved by the hardy life he had been leading,
5874  saved him from any consequences more serious; so that the archæologist,
5875  who was in capital spirits, rallied him on the prodigious appetite he
5876  displayed at breakfast.
5877  
5878  "I have to eat double to make up for the blood I lost last night," Jerry
5879  said, with a grin. "I find there's nothing for the appetite like a
5880  regular brush with the police. I've found it so before, when I was in
5881  college."
5882  
5883  After breakfast the two went on deck, and seated under the awning, with
5884  the beautiful bay before them and a soft air to bring a delicious
5885  coolness, they talked over the adventure of the previous night. Then
5886  from this they branched off to more general matters. Mr. Wrenmarsh was a
5887  man of wide experience and of good observation, and was well informed on
5888  almost every topic the talk touched upon. His tricks and eccentricities
5889  had been for the time being laid aside, or showed only as a flavor of
5890  personality piquant and attractive. Jerry found himself soothed and
5891  entertained, although, remembering his previous experience with the
5892  collector, he was not without a feeling that Wrenmarsh had a propensity
5893  to use speech as a squid does his ink, to conceal his course, and so
5894  wondered what the collector had still to gain. Wrenmarsh suddenly took
5895  to intricate and unintelligible sentences without warning and equally
5896  without apparent excuse, when Jerry brought him back to earth with a
5897  question what he intended to do next.
5898  
5899  "Do?" exclaimed Wrenmarsh, as if shocked and astonished by such an
5900  inquiry. "Of course I shan't think of setting foot on shore again till I
5901  get to England."
5902  
5903  Jerry hardly suppressed an instinctive whistle, and for a brief instant
5904  he had nothing to say; but after all he was not without a shrewdness of
5905  his own. He was still chagrined to remember that the archæologist had
5906  played upon him once for his own purposes, and he had at least learned
5907  that in dealing with this man it was necessary to be cautious.
5908  
5909  "To England?" he repeated in a voice so casual as to rouse Wrenmarsh and
5910  to tickle himself inwardly. "How do you go?"
5911  
5912  "Go?" once more echoed the other. "With you, of course."
5913  
5914  "Oh, are we going to England?" Jerry asked more carelessly than before.
5915  
5916  "Surely you are," Wrenmarsh retorted with some sharpness.
5917  
5918  "Are we really?" was Jerry's comment. A refrain from a song in a Pudding
5919  play popped into his head, and he hummed it in derision hardly
5920  disguised,--
5921  
5922  
5923       "You surprise me!"
5924  
5925  
5926  "Will you--er--say that again?" asked the collector most courteously.
5927  
5928  "Oh, quite unnecessary," Tab returned, not to be trapped into an
5929  apology. "It was only a bit of a song."
5930  
5931  He was filled with a pleasant feeling that he was bothering the
5932  collector, astute as that person was, and he determined, as the
5933  circumstances certainly were in his favor, to hold his own with him
5934  this time at least.
5935  
5936  "I don't think you have a very clear view of the case," Wrenmarsh said,
5937  after a moment of silent musing with contracted brow. "If you had, you'd
5938  see that it isn't possible for me to go ashore now, after that beastly
5939  business of last night. I assure you, I'm awfully sorry for that mess.
5940  There's another thing,--I couldn't get those boxes ashore from the yacht
5941  without their being examined, and then there'd be the devil of a row."
5942  
5943  "That must have occurred to you before you left Pæstum," Jerry remarked
5944  with coolness.
5945  
5946  Mr. Wrenmarsh did not move a muscle.
5947  
5948  "So it did," he said blandly; "but of course I knew it must have been
5949  evident to you also."
5950  
5951  Jerry laughed in spite of himself at the cool impudence of this.
5952  
5953  "I confess that it wasn't," he responded.
5954  
5955  "Even if it wasn't," the other went on, as smoothly as ever, "I never
5956  for an instant supposed that when once you'd started out to help me,
5957  you'd funk. That is a contingency, I confess, never occurred to my mind.
5958  I thought you were made of different stuff. You were clear game last
5959  night."
5960  
5961  Jerry looked at his guest and burst into deep-throated laughter.
5962  
5963  "Well, for clean cheek!" he cried. "Do you think I'm going to tote you
5964  about in a yacht I don't own for the rest of my life?"
5965  
5966  "Would you like to?" asked the collector, with a fresh aspect of
5967  interest. "Because in the Ægean Sea I've a"--
5968  
5969  "Whatever it is, please keep it to yourself, or you'll insist that I
5970  promised to help you with it," interrupted Tab grimly. "As for going to
5971  England in the present case, that's quite out of the question. What are
5972  you going to do? If you stay on board, you'll land in Boston."
5973  
5974  Mr. Wrenmarsh's face took on for an instant a look distinctly ugly. It
5975  suddenly occurred to Taberman that the collector was in rather an evil
5976  plight,--worse, indeed, than that from which the Merle had rescued him.
5977  
5978  "Surely you're not serious?" Wrenmarsh asked slowly.
5979  
5980  "I think I am," Jerry responded pleasantly. "What are you going to do?"
5981  
5982  "Damn!" the other broke out explosively, lying back in his chair and
5983  running his fingers through his gray-sprinkled locks.
5984  
5985  Jerry was too soft-hearted not to be touched by the other's perplexity,
5986  but an involuntary movement of sympathy which he made happened to give
5987  him a painful twinge in the arm, and he hardened his heart. There was a
5988  silence of some minutes, during which he tried to make out from the face
5989  of his companion what thoughts were passing behind that mask. Suddenly
5990  the cloud lifted from the face of Wrenmarsh, and he flashed a bright
5991  glance on Jerry.
5992  
5993  "Bless me," he cried gayly. "I might have thought!
5994  Plutus--Mammon--filthy lucre! But how extraordinary in an American--not
5995  to ask for it, you know! What'll you take for it?"
5996  
5997  "For what?" responded Tab, not catching his drift.
5998  
5999  He had a dreadful feeling that by becoming incomprehensible, the other
6000  might be getting the better of him.
6001  
6002  "What's to pay for a passage of myself and my boxes to--let us say
6003  Plymouth?"
6004  
6005  Indignation for the instant flared up in Jerry.
6006  
6007  "This is not a passenger ship," he responded brusquely.
6008  
6009  "Oh, of course not, my dear fellow; but as every man has his price, I
6010  suppose a yacht has too."
6011  
6012  Common-sense and indignation worked together now to keep Taberman from
6013  an angry retort. It flashed upon him that here was a chance, one in a
6014  thousand, to pay off the hands of the Merle without troubling the
6015  President; it was a chance, too, to score off this cheeky archæologist.
6016  Taberman had already noted that Wrenmarsh was a penurious soul who hated
6017  to part with money, and he felt something of the godly joy of the
6018  departing Israelites when Moses announced the project for the spoiling
6019  of the Egyptians. England was not such an impossible distance off. They
6020  might take the Great Circle track home. Surely if Jack--
6021  
6022  "Don't you see my position, Mr. Wrenmarsh?" he asked. "I haven't the
6023  power to dispose of the Merle. I'm simply in charge of her while the
6024  captain's ashore, don't you see? Still"--
6025  
6026  He paused dramatically.
6027  
6028  "Well?" ejaculated Wrenmarsh, apparently keeping his gaze fixed in the
6029  closest interest on the red sails of a big felucca that was standing in
6030  toward the Mole.
6031  
6032  "Well, I think I might be right in making a sort of conditional--a
6033  purely conditional"--he repeated the word for caution, wondering if he
6034  ought to make it any stronger--"arrangement. It wouldn't be valid
6035  without the sanction of the captain. You see that, of course."
6036  
6037  "Well?" repeated the other.
6038  
6039  "Do you see--merely conditional?" insisted Taberman.
6040  
6041  "Yes, I suppose so," assented the other grudgingly.
6042  
6043  "I might make a sort of conditional arrangement, then, to go to
6044  Plymouth, or perhaps to any other English port not too much out of the
6045  way, for a consideration of"--He paused again.
6046  
6047  "Ten pounds," suggested the archæologist.
6048  
6049  "Two hundred," said Jerry coolly.
6050  
6051  He could have hugged himself with joy at the sound of his own voice
6052  naming the sum in such a matter-of-fact fashion. He knew well enough
6053  that but for the enormous handicap which circumstances had put upon the
6054  archæologist he would have had no chance whatever to outmanoeuvre him,
6055  but this he did not bother to reflect on at the moment and might have
6056  had scruples about if he had. He gave himself up to the delight of
6057  feeling that he had distinctly the better of the man who had so carried
6058  him off his feet at Pæstum, and who had involved him in an affair of the
6059  seriousness of which Jerry had had good reason to meditate in the times
6060  in the night when his arm kept him awake. It was certainly something to
6061  have the upper hand now; and two hundred pounds, which he had named
6062  almost at random, multiplied itself in his head into a most satisfactory
6063  number of dollars.
6064  
6065  "Two hundred pounds!" cried out the archæologist, nearly jumping out of
6066  his chair.
6067  
6068  His affected surprise was dramatic, but unfortunately for its effect it
6069  was overdone, so that even Jerry felt it to be theatrical.
6070  
6071  "Shall we call it two hundred and fifty?" the mate asked, enjoying
6072  himself more every minute.
6073  
6074  "Two hundred and fifty devils!" shouted Wrenmarsh, who appeared more
6075  irritated, it seemed to Jerry, on account of being outmanoeuvred than
6076  because the price was so high.
6077  
6078  "Not devils--pounds," Tab responded, smiling at his own wit.
6079  
6080  "Leave off the two hundred," begged the collector.
6081  
6082  "The agreement is only conditional anyway," Jerry said, with something
6083  of an air, "but if it seems to you fairer, we'll leave off the fifty,
6084  and call it an even two hundred--one for you and one for those precious
6085  boxes, to be paid on arrival. I'm not a Neapolitan. Will you go ashore
6086  here or wait for the captain?"
6087  
6088  "I'll wait for the captain, Mr. Taberman," Wrenmarsh replied. He
6089  glowered across the bay for a moment, and then added, "He may not be so
6090  infernally exorbitant as you are."
6091  
6092  Jerry smiled secretly to himself, and resolved that at least Jack should
6093  be persuaded to make no easier terms. Then he went to write a note to
6094  summon the captain to come aboard to consider this proposition of taking
6095  a passenger.

6102  Chapter Fourteen
6103  
6104  CLEARING THE DECKS
6105  
6106  
6107  When Jack appeared on the Merle, rather late that afternoon, Jerry met
6108  him by the steps, his arm in a sling.
6109  
6110  "Good heavens, Tab," cried the captain, "what's the matter? What have
6111  you done to your arm, boy?"
6112  
6113  "Nothing much," Jerry answered. "Just got a little piece of the cutter
6114  in it in a night engagement. What the deuce kept you so long?"
6115  
6116  "But was it last night?" Jack insisted. "Did you get into trouble?"
6117  
6118  "We were under fire," Jerry laughed; "but I had the only casualty."
6119  
6120  "The devil you did! What sort of a trap did your infernal Englishman
6121  lead you into?"
6122  
6123  "That's just what I want to tell you before you see him. What in the
6124  world made you so late? I've been waiting all the afternoon."
6125  
6126  The captain's face grew radiant.
6127  
6128  "Well, you see," he returned, with a little laugh in his throat, "time
6129  passed so quickly, and Katrine and I had so much to talk about"--
6130  
6131  "Jacko! You've done it!" shouted Tab, loud enough to be heard from one
6132  end of the yacht to the other.
6133  
6134  The captain grinned warmly, and nodded with sparkling eyes.
6135  
6136  "Oh, good man!" cried Tab, wringing his hand. "Good old Jack! Long life
6137  and all happiness to you, you dear old pirate!"
6138  
6139  His words tumbled out helter-skelter, and his honest blue eyes were
6140  moist with pure joy at his friend's happiness. He admired Miss
6141  Marchfield from the bottom of his heart, and Jack was the dearest friend
6142  he could ever have. He rejoiced as sincerely and as warmly as if the
6143  good fortune of the captain had been his own.
6144  
6145  "Thank you, old man," laughed Jack, bubbling over with good spirits;
6146  "but if it hadn't been for you, I--I'd never have done it."
6147  
6148  "Tush!" flouted Jerry. "Don't talk bosh! It was only a matter of time
6149  anyway. But I'm glad it's all right."
6150  
6151  They had been standing at the head of the steps, and now the captain
6152  moved along the deck.
6153  
6154  "What did you send for me to come out in such a hurry for?" he
6155  inquired.
6156  
6157  "Hurry!" ejaculated Jerry. "Do you call this coming out in a hurry? If
6158  it hadn't been that you left a born diplomat in charge, you might have
6159  lost two hundred pounds by being so slow."
6160  
6161  "Two hundred pounds?" the other echoed. "What on earth are you talking
6162  about?"
6163  
6164  "Come into the cabin before you go aft," was Jerry's answer. "I want to
6165  tell you about that."
6166  
6167  "And about your arm, old man. What is the matter with you?"
6168  
6169  "That's part of it," Tab returned, as they went below together. "I'm
6170  trying among other things to recover damages."
6171  
6172  When some little time later the two friends came on deck and went aft to
6173  where the guest was sitting, Jack was in full possession of the whole
6174  situation.
6175  
6176  "Jack, Mr. Gordon Wrenmarsh; Mr. Wrenmarsh, Captain John Castleport,"
6177  Jerry said.
6178  
6179  "Pleased to meet you, Mr. Wrenmarsh," Jack said, extending his hand.
6180  
6181  He was evidently in the best of humor. His spirits on that day could
6182  hardly be other than at their highest, and he had been vastly amused by
6183  Jerry's plan of raising funds to pay off the men.
6184  
6185  "Thanks," responded the archæologist. "I was afraid the pleasure was
6186  largely mine. I've been expecting you all day."
6187  
6188  "Well," Jack said, seating himself comfortably, "I am here at last. I am
6189  sorry if I kept you waiting. You might have arranged anything with Mr.
6190  Taberman, though."
6191  
6192  "I tried to," Mr. Wrenmarsh responded dryly, "but he seemed to me so
6193  unpractical in his ideas that I thought it better to wait for you."
6194  
6195  "I hope you won't find me unsatisfactory in the same way," Jack
6196  returned. "At least I am practical enough to know that in this weather
6197  it will be more comfortable if we have something."
6198  
6199  He summoned Gonzague, and the trio were soon furnished with tall glasses
6200  of sangaree, which they sipped with relish.
6201  
6202  "Mr. Taberman has suggested,--though I fancy he's half in jest," began
6203  the collector, when these preliminaries had been attended to, "that two
6204  hundred pounds is a fair price for such a trivial service as running up
6205  to England and landing me and my boxes."
6206  
6207  "I am glad you think the matter trivial," observed Jack, with a smile;
6208  "it makes it so much easier for me to say that I do not find it
6209  convenient to go to England at all."
6210  
6211  "Oh, I say now," Wrenmarsh responded, with a sudden keen glance at Jack
6212  as if he were surprised at the quickness with which his remark had been
6213  met and turned against him; "of course you'll go to England. That was
6214  settled long ago, you know."
6215  
6216  "Was it? I supposed that I, as captain of the Merle, had some voice in
6217  such a matter."
6218  
6219  "Of course nothing was settled," broke in Jerry. "I made a conditional
6220  arrangement--entirely conditional, mind you--with Mr. Wrenmarsh that you
6221  would take him to England."
6222  
6223  "Yes; that is what I said," the collector asserted imperturbably. "Only
6224  the price that you named"--
6225  
6226  "Seems to me a very reasonable one," interpolated Jack.
6227  
6228  "Not seriously?" Wrenmarsh said, evidently determined not to show that
6229  he was at all ruffled. "Only consider, if I go ashore here, I may get--I
6230  might become a national complication. And you wouldn't want to be mixed
6231  up in that sort of a thing," he added, with a chuckle. "An international
6232  complication," he murmured to himself, as if the idea appealed so
6233  strongly to his vanity that he was half tempted to be put on land at
6234  once to take up the part. Then he recalled his wandering thoughts, and
6235  looked Captain Castleport in the eye. "If you land me in any country
6236  except England, I am quite done for, as you Americans would say. It
6237  stands to reason if there is any paying to be done, you should pay me
6238  for keeping you out of a scrape; for of course if I go ashore it will be
6239  known that the Merle ran away from the _carabinieri_ at Pæstum, and"--
6240  
6241  "Rubbish!" interrupted Jack brusquely. "Don't talk that kind of
6242  poppy-cock! Even if there were any truth in it, it wouldn't be decent
6243  for you to say so after getting the Merle into the scrape."
6244  
6245  "And giving me your word that the yacht was in no possible danger," put
6246  in Jerry indignantly.
6247  
6248  "Oh, no real danger, of course," Wrenmarsh said hurriedly, "only it
6249  might be unpleasant for you, and you might not like to be detained."
6250  
6251  "Why must you go to England?" asked Castleport. "Why not to Malta or
6252  Cyprus or Korfu even? They're protectorates and English ground."
6253  
6254  "The sun never sets, you know," responded Wrenmarsh, with his
6255  extraordinary ventral chuckle. "The truth is they won't do. Korfu and
6256  Cyprus would be as bad for me as Naples, on account of my reputation.
6257  I'm known to have run out a lot of things, you see. Gibraltar or Malta
6258  would suit me well enough--if it weren't for the same reason. There
6259  isn't a hotel on the entire shores of the Mediterranean that I could put
6260  up at with those boxes in safety."
6261  
6262  "I hardly suppose I'm expected to take that too literally," Jack said,
6263  with a smile.
6264  
6265  He reflected a moment. He could see that the collector certainly had
6266  good reason for wishing to remain on the yacht, and that it could not
6267  but be of very great convenience to him to be taken to England. He was
6268  no less convinced from what Jerry had told him that the antiquities
6269  which the archæologist had on board must be worth thousands of pounds,
6270  and that their possessor could afford to pay well for their safety. He
6271  was thoroughly stirred up, moreover, by the thought of the episode of
6272  the night before. That Jerry should have been put in actual peril of his
6273  life by Wrenmarsh for his own purposes was to Jack so outrageous that he
6274  was half tempted to order the collector and his boxes off the Merle at
6275  once to take his chances with the officials on the quays of Naples. As
6276  Jerry had planned reprisals along another line, however, and as after
6277  all Jack could not have brought himself to desert a man in extremity,
6278  the captain determined to go on as they had begun.
6279  
6280  "Two hundred pounds strikes me as fair enough," he said.
6281  
6282  "Too much--too much! Make it fifty," responded Wrenmarsh.
6283  
6284  "Two hundred!" repeated Jack.
6285  
6286  "I'm sorry; I can't do that," the collector said, with a great show of
6287  decision. "You'll have to take me to Malta. What'll you do that for?"
6288  
6289  "Three hundred," Jack returned quietly, although he could not refrain
6290  from a secret exchange of glances with Jerry.
6291  
6292  "What!" the other cried, in an exaggerated shriek. "A run like that?
6293  Three hundred pounds! It's not a twentieth the distance to England."
6294  
6295  "That's so," was the captain's answer, "but you see we should have a
6296  good deal less value in your company. Besides, you'd get your boxes _ex
6297  territorio_ a great deal quicker."
6298  
6299  He had by this time become so interested in the game he was playing that
6300  the beating of the collector seemed in itself a thing worth straining
6301  every nerve to gain.
6302  
6303  "They're _ex territorio_ now," Mr. Wrenmarsh said, "as they're on a
6304  foreign yacht. But no matter about that. What'll you take to set me over
6305  to Gibraltar?"
6306  
6307  "Oh, that would cost you three hundred and fifty, because there you're
6308  so much nearer England than you'd be at Malta."
6309  
6310  He glanced again at Jerry, with an inward chuckle at the utter
6311  balderdash he was talking and a consciousness how closely it resembled
6312  the nature of the arguments with which Wrenmarsh had beguiled Tab. For a
6313  minute there was silence, and then the archæologist spoke angrily.
6314  
6315  "You're too commercial," he said, with an unconcealed sneer. "I see no
6316  way in which we can come to an agreement. I never was equal to trading
6317  with a dollar-getting Yankee."
6318  
6319  Tab started and looked to hear Jack break out at an insult so gross, but
6320  the captain merely smiled.
6321  
6322  "As you are our guest," he said, "there's no chance for me to answer you
6323  properly, but you must remember we're not looking for a job. Shall I
6324  send you ashore now, or would it suit you to take a boat with me in half
6325  an hour? Or perhaps," he added, his manner most elaborately courteous,
6326  "on account of your boxes, it would suit you better to be set ashore
6327  after dark."
6328  
6329  "Give you one hundred pounds," the collector said, still fighting, and
6330  ignoring the captain's words entirely.
6331  
6332  "We need not go on with the wrangle," Jack said, rising. "I'm not
6333  bargaining with you. If it's worth two hundred pounds to you, all right.
6334  If it isn't, we'll part here, and hope you have the gratitude to
6335  appreciate what has already been done for you at the risk of Mr.
6336  Taberman's life. Come, we've wasted too much time over this already."
6337  
6338  "Do you think my time isn't worth anything?" cried the
6339  other,--apparently losing all control of his temper. "I've wasted too
6340  much already. Get up your damned anchor, you mercenary Yankee"--
6341  
6342  "Come, sir!" broke in Jack sharply, "apologize at once! At once! You
6343  have been insulting us this half hour like an utter cad, and I've made
6344  all the allowances I'm equal to."
6345  
6346  The collector regarded him with furious eyes, but seemed struggling with
6347  himself until he could command his manner and his voice.
6348  
6349  "I--I beg your pardon," he said in a hard tone. Then he added, in a
6350  voice softer and more grave, "Indeed, I beg your pardon most sincerely.
6351  My cursed temper got the better of me. Does your offer still hold?"
6352  
6353  "If you wish," Jack answered stiffly.
6354  
6355  "Then--two hundred pounds--I accept it. Two hundred pounds sterling, to
6356  be paid on our safe arrival in port at Plymouth." He sighed, and put
6357  out his hand to the captain. "Will you pardon my tongue?" he asked.
6358  
6359  There was more ingenuousness in this trifling act than in anything Tab
6360  or Jack had yet seen in him. The real man seemed for a moment to show;
6361  and as Jack accepted the collector's apology and took his hand, Jerry
6362  had a fleeting glimpse--short as a flash of changing light--of another
6363  and franker Wrenmarsh, accustomed to hide under a veil of shams and
6364  mockeries made necessary by his difficult vocation.
6365  
6366  Wrenmarsh then asked if he might have some letters mailed ashore, and
6367  Jack offered to take them himself in half an hour's time. While the
6368  collector was below writing these, the captain and the mate talked
6369  things over on deck. Tab had to congratulate Jack again, and over and
6370  over, fairly beaming with delight whenever he thought of the happy stage
6371  to which affairs had been brought. When he discovered that the captain
6372  had confessed the lifting of the Merle, he was for a moment
6373  disconcerted.
6374  
6375  "Oh, Jacko, how could you give that away?" he cried.
6376  
6377  "I had to be honest," Jack replied, and added, with a little shade of
6378  unconscious patronage, "You'll see how it is yourself, old man, when it
6379  comes your turn. You have to make a square deal, of course."
6380  
6381  "Yes, I s'pose so," assented the mate humbly. "I hope she won't tell
6382  Mrs. Fairhew."
6383  
6384  "Oh, we told her together," Jack stated cheerfully. "Katrine thought
6385  we'd better. I'm glad I did, too; for she's written home about meeting
6386  us, and it's sure to get round to Uncle Randolph sooner or later."
6387  
6388  "How did she take it?"
6389  
6390  "Oh, do you know," returned Jack, laughing at the remembrance of his
6391  talk with Mrs. Fairhew, "I think she was more bothered that she hadn't
6392  guessed it than she was shocked at us. She couldn't help letting me see
6393  that she thought it an awfully good joke on Uncle Randolph. She said she
6394  should write to him to-day and remind him that she'd often told him he
6395  tried to keep me in leading strings. She said she did have a suspicion
6396  from your jocoseness when we first came over that there was some joke
6397  about our coming, but we parried her questions so well she forgot all
6398  about it. She said nobody could have dreamed of anything so
6399  preposterous, so of course she didn't guess it."
6400  
6401  "Didn't she say it was on account of her age she didn't see through us?"
6402  queried Jerry, with a grin.
6403  
6404  "By Jove, she did; and then turned it off by saying she never supposed
6405  a Marchfield would be engaged to a pirate. She says, though, that I've
6406  got to cut back at once. She won't have me going about with Katrine in a
6407  stolen yacht."
6408  
6409  "It's time to start anyway. It'll be getting late by the time we're
6410  across, and if she's written home, the sooner the Merle is in Boston
6411  harbor the better. I suppose we can get off in a week?"
6412  
6413  "We go to-morrow," Jack answered calmly.
6414  
6415  "To-morrow! Great Scott! What are we sitting here for? There are oceans
6416  of things to be done."
6417  
6418  "Of course we can get stores at Plymouth if we need to, and I've already
6419  ordered a lot of things to come out to-night. We have to get Wrenmarsh
6420  safe, of course, and that'll take some time."
6421  
6422  "He's a windfall," commented Jerry.
6423  
6424  "And like most windfalls, not entirely sound? Tell Gonzague to fix up
6425  the stateroom Bardale had, the one next mine. I must get ashore now;
6426  she'll be waiting. You're to come to dinner."
6427  
6428  "I'll come fast enough. Oh, you bully old pirate, I'm awfully glad for
6429  you!"

6436  Chapter Fifteen
6437  
6438  IN THE CATTEWATER
6439  
6440  
6441  The Merle was at anchor off Plymouth.
6442  
6443  By the round brass ship's clock placed over the passageway door, in the
6444  saloon, Jerry could see that it was a little after ten o'clock. The
6445  yacht had come to anchor in the small hours, and the gentlemen had in
6446  consequence slept late. The dull light of an English morning in
6447  September came through the big skylight, and showed the captain, the
6448  mate, and Mr. Wrenmarsh lingering over their breakfast.
6449  
6450  "On my word, Mr. Wrenmarsh," said Tab, "we'll be sorry to lose you.
6451  You've been aboard so long and your"--he almost blurted out
6452  "eccentricities," but fortunately had the unusual luck to stop in time
6453  to substitute a better word--"your--er--conversation has such--er--has
6454  been so very entertaining, that is, that we're sure to miss you."
6455  
6456  "Ah, well," said the collector, "I'm in hopes that you've improved so
6457  much by contact with me that you'll be able to entertain each other."
6458  
6459  "Wouldn't you like to take passage across?" suggested Jack.
6460  
6461  "Your rates are too high," the other rejoined grimly. "Gonzague, _'n'
6462  altro bicchier' d' aqua fresca_."
6463  
6464  The old steward, who had come in while Jerry was speaking, served the
6465  archæologist with the ready alacrity which marked all he did, and then
6466  departed with a handful of dishes.
6467  
6468  "Why do you always speak to Gonzague in Italian?" inquired Jerry. "You
6469  said yesterday that you always had a reason for everything you do."
6470  
6471  "Oh," the guest returned, fixing his eyes not on the questioner but on
6472  the ceiling above him, "I speak to him in Italian because he understands
6473  it."
6474  
6475  "But he isn't an Italian," Tab objected.
6476  
6477  "No, but then I'm not either."
6478  
6479  "But he understands English, French, and Spanish, for the matter of
6480  that," Jerry persisted.
6481  
6482  Whenever Wrenmarsh began to talk in this whimsical fashion, Taberman had
6483  always a teasing desire to push him into a corner.
6484  
6485  "Ah, but, my dear fellow," Wrenmarsh replied, unaccountably addressing
6486  Jack, and making his words seem more distraught by one of his most
6487  earnest, almost burning glances, "I do not speak Spanish, you see."
6488  
6489  "Then why not French or English?"
6490  
6491  "Because they're so different," returned the collector.
6492  
6493  "Why, what rot!" Jerry burst out rudely; then as usual he added
6494  apologetically, "I beg your pardon, but I'm afraid I don't follow you."
6495  
6496  "Oh, no; I suppose not," Mr. Wrenmarsh rejoined with much sweetness. He
6497  rose, and with an entire change of manner, added briskly, "Well, I'm
6498  ready. As I wish to catch the eleven thirty-four for London, we must
6499  make haste; otherwise I shouldn't have time to take Mr. Castleport to
6500  the bank, and settle my financial obligations. Can we get ashore?"
6501  
6502  "Yes," answered Jack, rising also. "The cutter's ready, and your boxes
6503  are on board. By the by, you said you'd tell me how you dodge--pardon
6504  the word, we use it on the other side--the customs."
6505  
6506  "Simplest thing in the world," returned Wrenmarsh, lighting a cigarette.
6507  "Address my boxes to a good friend of mine in the British Museum. They
6508  go through the customhouse as things for the museum, you know."
6509  
6510  "Does your friend do that sort of thing as a business?" inquired Jerry
6511  with a laugh. "I wish you'd give me his name, so I could come that
6512  game."
6513  
6514  "His name is Gordon Wrenmarsh," said the collector quietly; "but his
6515  charges are high. Shall we go?"
6516  
6517  "Yes," Jack responded. "It is high time we were off. I'm not anxious to
6518  speed the parting guest, but a good send-off means an early start."
6519  
6520  Jerry left his place, and the three went on deck. The cutter, already
6521  manned, was by the steps. The bleak English air struck chill and raw to
6522  these men fresh from the warm sunshine of the Mediterranean. The harbor
6523  and sound, crowded with shipping as they were, seemed flat and dull; the
6524  Citadel, the Battery, the various docks and buildings were depressing. A
6525  great volume of dun coal-smoke overhanging the "Three Towns," from the
6526  Hamoaze to Sutton Pool, added to the general air of gloom. To cap all
6527  this, the fog was coming in from seaward, and already its ghostly
6528  echelons had floated past the north end of Drake Island. As the three
6529  men came on deck the cutter was bobbing up and down in the wash of the
6530  ferry which plies to and fro across the Cattewater, and which had just
6531  gone heavily past.
6532  
6533  "Dear England!" ejaculated Mr. Wrenmarsh fervently under his breath in
6534  the face of all this. Then turning to Taberman, "You're not coming
6535  ashore with us?"
6536  
6537  Jerry shook his bare head, and gave an exaggerated shiver for reply.
6538  
6539  "No?" the collector said. "Well, we'll say good-by here, then. Lucky we
6540  met, wasn't it? Those combinations--they make the world go round; stop
6541  it sometimes. Good-by. Pity, great pity, you weren't at Oxford, Mr.
6542  Taberman. It would have done you good, made a man of you."
6543  
6544  "Not if Harvard's failed to," retorted Jerry loyally. "Good-by, and good
6545  luck. Hope we'll meet again some day."
6546  
6547  They shook hands, and Mr. Wrenmarsh and Jack descended to the waiting
6548  cutter.
6549  
6550  "_Adio, Signor'_," called out old Gonzague, who was standing by the
6551  main-rigging.
6552  
6553  "_A riverderla forse_" returned the collector from the stern-sheets of
6554  the cutter.
6555  
6556  "_Il mondo è piccolo, Signor'. Spero_," answered the Provençal.
6557  
6558  "Oars!" cried Jack. "Bear away,--let fall,--ready,--pull." And the
6559  cutter bore away the strange collector toward the shore of his adopted
6560  country.
6561  
6562  Jerry watched the boat for a moment, his big heart not untouched by a
6563  sympathetic friendliness for the lonely man, whose life seemed to him so
6564  warped and melancholy. He half expected Wrenmarsh to look back to nod or
6565  to wave his hand, but the collector's eyes were turned steadily to the
6566  shore. It was chill on deck, and Tab went below.
6567  
6568  Gonzague was just taking away the last of the breakfast things. He set
6569  his tray on the table, and approached the mate deferentially.
6570  
6571  "Mistaire Taberman, sair," he said, putting his hand in his pocket, and
6572  drawing out a small square blue box and a note, "Mistaire Wrainmairsh he
6573  geeve me de box and de lettair--also a crown in extrair dat I geeve dem
6574  to you when he have leef."
6575  
6576  "Eh? what?" asked Jerry. "Oh, I see. Thank you."
6577  
6578  He sat down on the port transom, and opened the box. It contained a
6579  small object carefully wrapped in tissue paper. He unfolded the paper,
6580  and between his fingers a gold finger-ring slipped on to the green
6581  corduroy cushion of the transom.
6582  
6583  "Great Scott!" he ejaculated. Then he picked it up and examined it
6584  carefully.
6585  
6586  In a thin band of red gold was set a carnelian of beautiful tone, the
6587  color of a red hyacinth blossom. The stone was oval, cut with an
6588  exquisite design in intaglio. It represented a god holding a trident in
6589  his left hand, and on his right a small winged figure. His right foot
6590  rested on a stone, and he was gazing at the figure he held. The gem was
6591  inscribed with the Greek letters [Greek: LIL].
6592  
6593  Jerry tore open the note. It read as follows:--
6594  
6595  
6596       Really, my dear fellow, had you viewed me more as a friend and less
6597       as a curiosity, you might have found it to your advantage. But to
6598       the point. I hope you will wear the ring in memory of our little
6599       escapade. The figure represents Poseidon, holding a victoriole in
6600       his hand; and is, as the letters signify, designed to commemorate
6601       the naval victory of Lilybæum (Capo Boao), in which some of the
6602       original wearer's ancestors (more likely pretended than real) were
6603       evidently supposed to have taken part. Of course the wearer, though
6604       not the cutter, was a Roman; but you won't mind that. Not a bit. So
6605       no one gets hurt--your arm, you know--in my behalf without cause to
6606       remember the fact--pleasantly. The stone is by no means the best
6607       that I obtained, but it seemed appropriate. Poseidon with a
6608       victoriole--usually an attribute of Zeus Soter (see your
6609       Furtwängler's A. G.)--is rare enough to give the thing value.
6610  
6611       With merriment,
6612  
6613       WRENMARSH.
6614  
6615  
6616  "By Jove!" cried Jerry to himself, gloating over the ring, "what a calf
6617  I was to that--that white man! By Gad, though, he was a stunner, and no
6618  mistake!"
6619  
6620  He slipped the gold band on his finger. After a time of admiration he
6621  took a book from the shelf, and tried to read; but every minute or two
6622  he stopped to look again at the jewel.
6623  
6624  He had not turned many pages when he heard a boat alongside, and a
6625  strange voice hailing.
6626  
6627  "Hallo," he thought. "I wonder what that is. It can't be the port
6628  officer; we satisfied him at daybreak."
6629  
6630  He tossed aside his book, and went on deck. A shabby jolly-boat was
6631  lying alongside. Jerry noted instantly and with consternation that she
6632  was manned by six men in uniform, in charge of a burly old fellow
6633  liberally adorned with brass buttons and gold braid, who looked to be
6634  every inch a sea-dog. At a second glance Tab decided that these men were
6635  not government employees, such as coast-guards, but belonged to some
6636  sort of a company. With one stunning blow, sudden as the bursting of a
6637  waterspout, the truth flashed over him; at the last, at the very last,
6638  when they had escaped so long that they had practically ceased to think
6639  of the danger, the agent of Lloyd's was upon them.
6640  
6641  "Hello there, what d'ye want?" called out the man doing anchor-watch.
6642  
6643  "Captain aboard?" demanded the burly officer in charge.
6644  
6645  "No," answered the hand suspiciously. "What will you have?"
6646  
6647  "I want to see the officer in charge, my spruce little sea-cook,"
6648  returned the big man genially; and the grating of the steps being handy,
6649  without further ceremony he came aboard.
6650  
6651  The sailor keeping the deck, although of a slow and plodding
6652  disposition, might have resented the coolness of the stranger, had Jerry
6653  given him time; but with a commendable promptness and a sinking heart
6654  the mate advanced. He told Jack afterward that he felt as if he were
6655  leading a forlorn hope, and had not the remotest idea of what he had
6656  better do or say.
6657  
6658  "I am in charge here," he said in a perfectly neutral voice. "What do
6659  you want?"
6660  
6661  "You are Captain Castleport?" inquired the big man, giving Jerry a keen
6662  glance not without a suspicion of kindly humor.
6663  
6664  He was a fine, strapping creature of perhaps forty-five or fifty, with
6665  fair hair, and a large bushy beard tawny as a lion's mane.
6666  
6667  "Captain Castleport is ashore, sir. I am the mate."
6668  
6669  "Mr. Taberman, eh?" asked the other. "May I see you in private for a
6670  minute or two, sir? I'm Lloyd's deputy inspector for Plymouth. I've been
6671  hunting about in the fog for you these thirty minutes past. I thought
6672  you were nigh out o' the Cattewater, over toward the Hoe."
6673  
6674  "Will you come below?" said Jerry grimly.
6675  
6676  Inwardly he groaned for the arrival of Jack. This was a task he felt
6677  himself unable to deal with. Had the emergency called simply for
6678  physical powers or for manual dexterity, the chances were large that he
6679  could rise to the occasion; but in a pass where the demand was for
6680  mental adroitness and nimble wits, Jerry knew the captain to be
6681  infinitely his superior. He determined to devote himself to gaining
6682  time, and to refrain from committing himself until his comrade should
6683  come aboard.
6684  
6685  Jerry escorted the burly guest to the cabin without further speech, and
6686  turned to ask him to be seated. The visitor at once drew over his
6687  jovial face like a veil a serious expression, and regarded Taberman
6688  with the greatest gravity. Unbuttoning the top of his serge jacket, he
6689  thrust his hand into an inner pocket as if it were a dip-net, and
6690  brought it up again full of dismally official-looking documents.
6691  
6692  "This is bad business, sir," he remarked, eyeing the mate as if to be
6693  sure he was producing a proper impression.
6694  
6695  "Eh?" ejaculated Jerry, trying to look like consolidated innocence.
6696  
6697  "P'haps you'll be so good's to look these through, sir," the Englishman
6698  went on, proffering his batch of papers.
6699  
6700  "Are they for me or the captain?" asked Taberman, fencing to gain time.
6701  
6702  "Why, as to that," the official replied, "I expect what they contain's
6703  ekally to your int'rest and 'is."
6704  
6705  "Sit down, please," Jerry said, with a confused wave of the hand, which
6706  seemed to invite the visitor to occupy all the seats in the cabin at
6707  once. "You may be right, but I shouldn't want to look any important
6708  papers over until the captain'd seen them."
6709  
6710  "Oh, that don't matter," the other said easily, as he settled himself in
6711  a chair. "I don't think you 'ave any cause to mind, sir. You represent
6712  'im aboard."
6713  
6714  "Yes," Jerry returned, obstinately determined that nothing should make
6715  him go through the papers without Jack; "but if you're not too much
6716  pressed for time, I'd much rather wait for the captain. He'll be here
6717  presently."
6718  
6719  "Why, sir, for the matter o' that, I dunno's I've much to 'urry me this
6720  mornin'; an' I must say I'd rather like a look at 'im. 'E must be a rare
6721  one."
6722  
6723  "Then," Jerry said, with infinite relief, "we'll wait till he gets
6724  aboard."
6725  
6726  He rang, and Gonzague appeared. The old Provençal stood stroking his
6727  mustache and watching the Englishman furtively out of the corners of his
6728  eyes, as if he appreciated the situation and hoped to have orders to
6729  assist in throwing him overboard. The glance of the bluff Briton at the
6730  same time lighted up in evident anticipation that the appearance of the
6731  steward meant refreshments.
6732  
6733  "Gonzague, I'll have a little Scotch and soda. Will you take a glass of
6734  anything, sir?"
6735  
6736  "Why, sir, seein' 's I 'ave to wait a bit, I'm not strong agin a finger
6737  or two."
6738  
6739  "What will you have?" asked Jerry, enormously relieved to get on ground
6740  so safe as that of playing the host.
6741  
6742  "I like red rum 's well 's most, sir," replied the other, his jolly eyes
6743  twinkling. "It's sort o' oilin' to the in'ards."
6744  
6745  They were soon served, and Gonzague, on leaving the cabin, placed the
6746  spirits and a siphon in most engaging proximity to the guest. Time
6747  passed in the exchange of more or less nautical chit-chat for half an
6748  hour or so; when, to the great comfort of Jerry, who had been listening
6749  with one ear to the talk of his companion and with the other for the
6750  coming of the captain, Jack's hail sounded outside. Jerry, listening
6751  acutely, heard Castleport pause on deck, and at the companion-way caught
6752  a syllable or two in the unmistakable tones of Gonzague, so that he
6753  apprehended that the captain would come to the interview forewarned.
6754  
6755  The captain came briskly into the cabin, his blue pea-jacket beaded with
6756  little globules of moisture from the fog, his hair damp and clinging to
6757  his temples.
6758  
6759  "Hallo, Tab," he said. "The fog's as thick as it was the night we
6760  started. Ah!"
6761  
6762  The exclamation cleverly conveyed the impression that he perceived the
6763  guest for the first time, and apologized for not being prepared to meet
6764  him.
6765  
6766  "Jack, this is Lloyd's deputy inspector, Mr. ----?" Jerry began, and
6767  stopped with an interrogative inflection.
6768  
6769  "My name, sir, 's Tom Mainbrace."
6770  
6771  "Mr. Thomas Mainbrace," Jerry concluded his presentation. "Mr.
6772  Mainbrace, Captain Castleport."
6773  
6774  "Pleased to know ye, cap'n," the Englishman said cheerfully, as Jack
6775  bowed. "Yes, sir; I'm Lloyd's deputy inspector."
6776  
6777  "I saw your boat alongside," Jack returned pleasantly. "We haven't any
6778  deputies aboard that need inspecting, though."
6779  
6780  "'Aven't ye?" the visitor asked, his eyes twinkling so that the laugh
6781  with which he followed his words seemed a sort of overflow of their
6782  merriment. "I kind o' thought there might be a deputy owner or som'thin'
6783  o' the sort 'ere."
6784  
6785  Jack apparently tried to look grave, but ended by grinning in spite of
6786  himself. He put out his hand and laid his fingers on the papers.
6787  
6788  "You have business with us?" he asked.
6789  
6790  "Yes, sir. The mate 'ere, 'e said 'e 'd rather not begin on it till you
6791  come aboard, sir."
6792  
6793  "Quite right," Jack responded quietly. "Shall I read these papers?"
6794  
6795  "Yes, if ye'll be so good, sir," Mr. Mainbrace said seriously, and not
6796  without a trace of regret in his jovial, weather-beaten face.
6797  
6798  The captain seated himself with deliberation, and began to read; the
6799  Englishman applied himself afresh to his glass, and Taberman watched
6800  closely for a lead. Jerry was not clear what line was to be taken in
6801  this difficult situation, and was keenly anxious to back up the captain
6802  in any way possible. To his surprise Jack began first to smile, then to
6803  grin; from that to chuckle gleefully, and at last he broke out into
6804  full-throated laughter.
6805  
6806  "By Jove!" he cried, striking his knee with the hand that held the
6807  papers. "But that is one on Uncle Randolph, and no mistake!"
6808  
6809  The deputy inspector looked up with an expression of bewilderment, and
6810  Jerry felt that he was no more enlightened as to what Jack had in mind
6811  than was the guest.
6812  
6813  "What is it?" Tab asked.
6814  
6815  "Oh, we're run down at last! Think of our being nabbed at the last
6816  moment, when we've done all we wanted to with the yacht!" And he fell to
6817  laughing again, as if being caught red-handed in a pirated yacht were
6818  the merriest jest in the world.
6819  
6820  Taberman was still completely bewildered, but he at least perceived that
6821  Jack was bound to carry off the matter with laughter; and by way of
6822  assisting as well as he could, he began also to laugh. He took the
6823  papers, and glanced at them enough to see that one was a letter from
6824  Lloyd's, containing a notification of the Merle's disappearance, with a
6825  description of the yacht and a specification of her captors; the other a
6826  warrant for search and apprehension. He followed Jack's lead, and if his
6827  efforts did not ring as true, he at least made more noise.
6828  
6829  "That's rich!" he roared. "Ha! Ha! Ha!"
6830  
6831  He thrust the papers back to the captain, who tossed them on the table,
6832  and both together they broke out afresh.
6833  
6834  "Excuse our laughing," Jack said, turning to the inspector, who gazed
6835  from one to the other as if he thought they had gone mad; "but really
6836  it's too ripping!"
6837  
6838  "Ain't ye the parties?" demanded the official sternly.
6839  
6840  "Oh, we're the parties all fast enough; but--Well, now, look here. This
6841  yacht belongs to my uncle, you see."
6842  
6843  "Yes, sir," replied the honest Mainbrace, evidently puzzled, as he would
6844  have put it, to make out the other's numbers, but still Britannically
6845  deferential to the nephew of a man who was able to own a yacht such as
6846  the Merle.
6847  
6848  "Well, you see, I ran away with her because he wouldn't let me come
6849  across, and he's had no good of her the whole summer. From your papers I
6850  judge he looked for me on the other side six weeks before he notified
6851  you at all. You see how much of the summer that leaves him; and now,
6852  just as I'm starting to carry her back as fast as the wind will take
6853  her, you step in and stop us."
6854  
6855  "Why, ye see, sir," began the inspector, evidently endeavoring to
6856  accommodate himself to the new light thrown by the captain on the
6857  situation, "the fact is 'e says 'e wants 'er in a 'urry."
6858  
6859  "He won't get her, then," Jack said with a grin. "By the time you've
6860  red-taped her, and charged for her, and negotiated her, and sent her
6861  over with a hired crew, it'll be December at the very earliest--to say
6862  nothing of the twenty or thirty pounds he'll have to pay you and the
6863  cost of the crew you send her over by. It is hard lines for Uncle
6864  Randolph."
6865  
6866  "It is so," Jerry agreed, fervently glad to be at last in possession of
6867  the way Jack meant to work.
6868  
6869  "I'm really sorry for Uncle Randolph," Jack continued, sobering down.
6870  "But then, he might have trusted me to bring the Merle back."
6871  
6872  "Ye ain't takin' it too much to 'eart, are ye, sir?" queried the big
6873  Englishman, with a look so humorous and quizzical that Jerry was seized
6874  by a dreadful suspicion that the twinkling eyes saw through the whole
6875  scheme of bluff.
6876  
6877  "Not I," Jack assented blithely; "though of course I'd rather have taken
6878  the yacht home myself. What's the next move? Do you put us in irons, or
6879  hang us to the crosstree-ends?"
6880  
6881  "Why, they sent word from Lloyd's," replied Mainbrace, with the
6882  unmistakable grin of a man who regards himself as a humorist, "that the
6883  owner said not to be too 'ard on ye. I expect 't'll be no worse nor
6884  transportation for life." Then he put on a graver and more professional
6885  look, and added, "I'm afraid we'll 'ave to be more serious, sir. Will ye
6886  kindly show me your papers and the log? I suppose you 'ave 'em 'andy."
6887  
6888  "Certainly," the captain said, also assuming an official air. "Jerry,
6889  will you give the inspector the papers? I'll get the log."
6890  
6891  The examination of the papers was a short matter, and then they took up
6892  the log. It was at once evident that the Englishman had a keen curiosity
6893  to discover what the young men had been doing with the Merle, and that
6894  he was no less eager in his interest in all things nautical. Jerry sat
6895  by in almost open-mouthed admiration to see bow the captain took
6896  advantage of both these characteristics. Jack could be most attractive,
6897  and from the start it was evident that he was doing his best to please
6898  Mr. Mainbrace. He explained all the manoeuvres of that memorable night
6899  when the Merle had been spirited away in the fog, while the jolly face
6900  of the deputy inspector became more and more radiant with each new
6901  development of the story. The charts were produced, each detail of
6902  seamanship carefully brought out, and the whole episode lived over
6903  again. Jack warmed to his subject as he went on; Jerry threw in a word
6904  now and then when the captain in his eagerness seemed in danger of
6905  forgetting to mention some detail; the Englishman listened with chuckles
6906  and with laughter which soon came to be devoid of the slightest pretense
6907  of official dignity; and, in a word, the three became as merry and
6908  companionable over the log as if they were all pirates together.
6909  Mainbrace had been a sailor and a mate in his day, and showed the
6910  keenest zest for every nautical experience. There is no surer bond of
6911  comradeship than mutual love of the sea; and despite differences of
6912  race, age, and social position, Jack, Jerry, and the deputy inspector
6913  fraternized over the Merle's log as only sailors can.
6914  
6915  The log-book was read to the last entry. Over the account of the gale
6916  the yacht had encountered on her way across the Atlantic Mainbrace
6917  became as excited as if he had had a personal stake in the safety of the
6918  Merle. His ejaculations became more and more emphatic and more and more
6919  picturesque, and his rejoicing over the safe weathering of the storm
6920  almost as fervid as if he had been in it himself. The race at Nice Jack
6921  told of with as little reflection on the unsportsmanlike conduct of Lord
6922  Merryfield as was possible; but the jovial countenance of Mainbrace
6923  darkened, and he expressed an opinion of the absent nobleman which was
6924  sufficiently tonic to satisfy even Taberman. Jack said afterward that by
6925  the time they got through the log a quotation from "Horatius" popped
6926  into his head, and he came very near breaking out with it:--
6927  
6928  
6929       With weeping and with laughter
6930         Still is the story told.
6931  
6932  
6933  To which Jerry replied that he couldn't think of quotations, he was so
6934  carried away by the enthusiastic delight of the jolly old inspector and
6935  the quaint ways in which it was expressed.
6936  
6937  When at last the record was closed, the conversation still at first ran
6938  on the cruise, but soon it began to take a turn which made Jerry prick
6939  up his ears anew. The inspector remarked, with an exceedingly droll
6940  twinkle of his eyes, that duty was duty, but that he would be summarily
6941  dealt with if he wouldn't feel bad to have to bear on hard on a couple
6942  of fellows that had played the biggest joke he ever heard of in his
6943  life, and had carried the whole thing through with so much cleverness
6944  and grit. To this Jack responded that he was most appreciative of the
6945  kindness of Mr. Mainbrace, but that of course duty was duty--although it
6946  would really have been luck for the owner of the Merle, quite as much as
6947  for himself and his mate, if the yacht could have gone on her way
6948  uninterrupted. To this in turn Mainbrace gave his assent, and went on to
6949  say that he must, of course, carry out instructions, and that he was
6950  legally empowered to leave a keeper on board until he could come out
6951  again to-morrow with directions he expected to receive from London.
6952  
6953  "Though I dunno," he added drolly, "'s it's safe to trust a man with ye.
6954  Ye're cap'ble o' runnin' off with 'im."
6955  
6956  "We might," Jack responded brightly. "I wouldn't be responsible."
6957  
6958  "Or we might throw him overboard," suggested Jerry, with the broadest
6959  possible grin.
6960  
6961  "Most o' my men kin swim some," Mainbrace retorted. "I should 'ave to
6962  tell 'im 'f 'e got overboard to tow the yacht in shore."
6963  
6964  The jest was not of the first water, but they had got to a merry mood,
6965  and it was properly laughed over. Then Mainbrace, in high good humor,
6966  went on to say that he'd been so well treated, and he had so enjoyed the
6967  log, that he thought on the whole he would not put a man in charge. He
6968  added that it was late, and he must be on his way ashore now, but that
6969  they might expect him out again to-morrow.
6970  
6971  "I'm sorry I 'ave to bother ye, gentlemen," he added, as they went on
6972  deck. "I've been to sea myself too many years not to 'ate this bloody
6973  red-tape business,--an' they do reel it off by the cable-length when
6974  they 'ave 'arf a chance."
6975  
6976  The inspector's jolly-boat, the most appropriate of conveyances for the
6977  jovial sea-dog, was still alongside. The fog had lightened somewhat, and
6978  watery beams of the sun leaked through it overhead. As Mr. Mainbrace was
6979  about to descend the steps to the boat, he paused a moment and pulled at
6980  his thick beard as if meditating profoundly.
6981  
6982  "I'm 'most afraid if you gentlemen took it into your 'eads to give us
6983  the slip we shouldn't know it on shore in this 'ere fog," he observed,
6984  casting a queer, sidling glance at Jack.
6985  
6986  "It is trusting somewhat to luck to leave us," the captain responded
6987  coolly, "and I want to say now that I appreciate your kindness in not
6988  forcing a keeper on us."
6989  
6990  "Well, cap'n," continued the inspector, gazing out over the water with
6991  the look of one who has no personal interest in the matter under
6992  discussion, "I was goin' to say, if you get a good chance, you'd better
6993  shift your berth. You'll find it kind o' snugger ridin' some ways along
6994  to the west'ard, I expect. But you know best, o' course. All is, you're
6995  in a tightish place here. I alers liked more sea-room myself. Good-day,
6996  sir."
6997  
6998  "Good-day. Maybe you'll find we've shifted by to-morrow. If we have,
6999  it'll be to westward."
7000  
7001  "I'll come out to-morrow," said the old sailor in his most official
7002  manner. Then he looked from one to the other with his merriest twinkle
7003  and an emphatic nod. "Duty is duty," he remarked. "Good-day, sirs."
7004  
7005  He turned to descend, but suddenly Jack arrested him.
7006  
7007  "Oh, you've forgotten your pipe," he said.
7008  
7009  "My pipe?" echoed Mainbrace, stopping short.
7010  
7011  "Yes, I'll get it."
7012  
7013  The captain dashed into the cabin, and reappeared with a silver-mounted
7014  briarwood, colored just enough to suggest a comfortable chimney-corner
7015  and a mind at ease.
7016  
7017  "You left it on the table," he said, presenting it to the big inspector.
7018  
7019  The other took it with an expression queerly compounded of surprise,
7020  awkwardness, amusement, and delight.
7021  
7022  "Thank ye, sir," he said. "It's 'ansome of you to fetch it up
7023  ye'self,--most 'ansome. I'm mortal fond o' that pipe."
7024  
7025  He regarded it affectionately a moment, and then stowed it away inside
7026  his jacket. Then he turned again to go down to the waiting jolly-boat.
7027  
7028  "I'll come out to-morrow," he called up to them. "Duty is duty.
7029  Good-day, sirs."
7030  
7031  "Good-day," they called in concert; and off went the deputy inspector
7032  toward the hardly perceptible shore through the fog.
7033  
7034  "By George, he's a brick!" Jack cried.
7035  
7036  "Right-o," assented Jerry, "but it took you to cement him."
7037  
7038  "Atrocious! If you're going to pun like that you must be taken home to
7039  your family at once. 'Duty is duty'! Did you see the solemn wink the
7040  old fellow tipped me when he spoke of shifting to westward? I thought I
7041  should burst out laughing on the spot, and give the whole thing away.
7042  How's the water?"
7043  
7044  "Tanks chock-a-block. Gonzague had them filled from the water-boat this
7045  morning. Did you get your money?"
7046  
7047  "Every pound of it. Wrenmarsh took me to the bank and identified me, and
7048  was mighty nice about the whole thing. Provisions are O.K. Off we go.
7049  Call the watch."
7050  
7051  "Yes, but see my ring first," Tab said, holding it out.
7052  
7053  In half an hour the Merle was changing her berth to the westward.

7060  Chapter Sixteen
7061  
7062  STORM!
7063  
7064  
7065  A gray sea, a gray sky, and the Mid-Atlantic Ocean in September. Over
7066  the heaving waters the Merle, under reduced canvas, was staggering
7067  westward on the port-tack with a stiff southerly breeze. Jack, clad in
7068  his yellow oil-skins like the rest of the hands, was standing just
7069  outside the cockpit on the windward side of the yacht. Jerry was asleep
7070  below. Having had the early morning watch, he had turned in directly
7071  after breakfast. The captain glanced aloft uneasily, and wondered if
7072  they were going to encounter on their return such a gale as they had
7073  weathered while going over. He reluctantly admitted to himself that
7074  there was every appearance of dirty weather, and thought he had better
7075  step below to take a look at the glass.
7076  
7077  He pushed back the companion, and descended. The cabin was stuffy and no
7078  warmer than the air without. The racks were on the table, and the lamps
7079  swung in erratic circles in their gimbals. The barometer, a beautifully
7080  finished instrument of the columnar type, was placed against the
7081  after-bulkhead of the saloon on the starboard beside a closet door, its
7082  slender length enclosed in bronze. It gyrated wildly, in unison with the
7083  Thom's list-indicator above it. Jack steadied the tube with his hand,
7084  and looked anxiously to see if the mercury had fallen.
7085  
7086  "Good God!" he burst out.
7087  
7088  At eight bells that morning the vernier of the glass had been set at
7089  29.32. With staring eyes, Jack saw that now, little more than two hours
7090  later, the mercury had sunk to 27.09,--a drop portentous of a furious
7091  gale. For one brief moment, in the face of approaching danger, and
7092  filled with a quick sense of his great responsibility, he stood
7093  appalled. He put his hand to his forehead as if he were dizzy and found
7094  it hard to think.
7095  
7096  "How's the glass, Jack?" asked a voice beside him. He turned with
7097  troubled eyes to see Tab in his pajamas, a freshly lighted cigarette
7098  between his fingers. "What's the trouble?" the mate demanded instantly,
7099  seeming bewildered at the captain's appearance.
7100  
7101  "What brought you out here?" the captain retorted, though why he should
7102  have asked he could not have told.
7103  
7104  "Heard you exclaiming. What's the trouble?"
7105  
7106  "Look!" Jack answered, pointing to the glass.
7107  
7108  "All that!" gasped Jerry.
7109  
7110  "Get your togs on," was the only reply Jack offered. "Be quick, and come
7111  on deck."
7112  
7113  Jerrold left him without a word, and padded off to his cabin. Jack reset
7114  the vernier, and went out. To his disturbed mind it seemed as if in the
7115  brief interval during which he had been below the whole appearance of
7116  nature had grown more ominous. In five minutes Jerry was with him.
7117  
7118  "Well, Jack?"
7119  
7120  "I've made up my mind what to do," the captain announced. "It's going to
7121  blow fit to take your hair out by the roots: that much is sure."
7122  
7123  Jerry nodded soberly, and looked his friend straight in the eye.
7124  
7125  "We'll have to lay-to before we see the end of this, and I'd rather do
7126  so at sea-anchor 'n any other way. What do you think?"
7127  
7128  "That's right enough. I suppose we'd better make ready now?"
7129  
7130  "We sha'n't have much time when it does come. We must get a mess of
7131  things together up for'ard fit to hold a liner. We'll need it."
7132  
7133  Jack got the hands together around the winch forward, and set them at
7134  once, under his direction, to the making of the "sea-anchor." The
7135  spinnaker-boom and the two shorter boat-booms were first lashed firmly
7136  together with inch rope in a rough isosceles triangle.
7137  
7138  "Now," Jack ordered, "fetch the old staysail, and bend it on in the
7139  frame."
7140  
7141  "How are you going to ballast the thing?" asked Tab. "It'll float flat
7142  if you don't give it a sinker."
7143  
7144  "I fancy the market-boat's killock would be about the right thing if we
7145  could get at it," Jack answered. "Do you know where"--
7146  
7147  "Yes, yes," interrupted Jerry hastily. "It's with the rest of her gear.
7148  I'll get it." And he went aft.
7149  
7150  Although the wind had not as yet increased in violence, Jack, standing
7151  as he did almost at the peak of the vessel, felt the motion much more
7152  than he had farther aft. The great gray-green seas heaved hard about the
7153  plunging yacht, and every now and then she ran bowsprit under. She was a
7154  rather dry boat, fortunately, of the "hollow bow" model, and in the
7155  fifteen or twenty minutes that the men had been working on the anchor,
7156  she had not taken any waves aboard. The spindrift, it is true, flew
7157  across her by the bucketful, but the men, dressed in their oilers,
7158  blinked the cold water out of their eyes and went on with their work.
7159  Before Jerry returned, however, as the crew were bending the old
7160  staysail to the triangular frame, the captain, to his consternation, saw
7161  that the Merle was just working her way up the breast of a mighty hill
7162  of water with all likelihood of burying herself in the rising wall of a
7163  wave ahead.
7164  
7165  "'Ware water!" he shouted.
7166  
7167  The men dropped their work and caught at whatever was nearest at hand.
7168  Some threw an arm about the bollard by the knighthead; some jumped for
7169  the winch; two men got a tight grip on the large ring-bolts by the port
7170  cat-heads; Jack himself leaped for the winch and put his right arm
7171  around the drum.
7172  
7173  The Merle labored to the crest of the hill of water. It sank away
7174  beneath her instantly, and she shot down the slope of the wave into the
7175  trough of the sea with a headlong, staggering rush. Towering above her
7176  was the roughened, foam-blotched face of the succeeding wave. She tried
7177  bravely to climb it, but she was too near, the angle was too sharp; she
7178  could not so quickly recover from the impetus of her downward plunge.
7179  She seemed to tremble--to hesitate--for an instant, and then as if in
7180  the courage of despair, to leap forward with a jerk into the very midst
7181  of the flood as if she would force her way through its tons of swinging
7182  sea-water.
7183  
7184  Jack went to the deck under the tremendous blow of the on-rushing wave
7185  as if he had been struck down by a thunderbolt. He felt the shock, the
7186  biting cold of the water, and then it seemed as if a giant had gripped
7187  him with hands of ice and were trying to wrench him from his hold. He
7188  clung on, drenched, bewildered, desperate, until he wondered if his arm
7189  would be pulled out of its socket. He had a stifling sensation of having
7190  been for hours without air; he felt as if he were being dragged by some
7191  terrible power swiftly through the sea miles below the surface. On a
7192  sudden he again felt the deck under him, and opened his eyes. The Merle
7193  had forced her way through the wave, and they were again free. He
7194  gasped, spluttered, and rose to his feet, the water streaming from him.
7195  Inside the bulwarks to starboard the green, foam-mixed brine washed
7196  about knee-deep, and was pouring with a hoarse gurgling out of the
7197  scuppers forward. The "anchor" had been swept bodily aft as far as the
7198  foremast, and there was jammed between the mast itself and the
7199  weather-shrouds. Drenched and cursing, the men squelched their way aft,
7200  dislodged the structure, and dragged it forward again. Luckily the
7201  mishap, really a slight one of twenty seconds' duration, had wrought no
7202  damage which could not be easily repaired, and so the crew took up their
7203  work where they had left it.
7204  
7205  Jerry reappeared with the killock of the market-boat just as they got
7206  into place once more.
7207  
7208  "Did you get wet?" he asked cheerily, with a broad grin which showed
7209  that he saw what had happened.
7210  
7211  "What do you think?" burst out the captain hotly. "No; I got dry, damn
7212  it!"
7213  
7214  "Did you really, though! Well, I thought you looked damp."
7215  
7216  Jack paid this boyish jest with a word that was sharp and a look that
7217  was too near a grin not to take the sting from it. He took the killock
7218  that Jerry had brought, and had the men make it fast to the lower point
7219  of the kite-like frame where the short boat-booms met. To the ends of
7220  the long spinnaker-boom he fastened lengths of strong inch Manilla, and
7221  a piece somewhat shorter to the point where the killock was attached.
7222  The captain meant that the "sea-anchor," when in the water, should ride
7223  not exactly vertical, but that by the shorter line the weighted point
7224  should be lifted a little toward the yacht as the Merle dragged back on
7225  it. In the end of each of these lines a bow-line was bent, and through
7226  the bights of them he had the rode bent and made fast. The whole
7227  contrivance was then like a triangular kite weighted at the point made
7228  by the shorter sides, and held by lines from the three corners joined on
7229  the rode, which corresponded to the string. When the work was finished
7230  Jack inspected it all carefully, and examined the fastenings.
7231  
7232  "It's a rough enough concern," he said to Jerry; "but it's stanch, and
7233  if we have to use it, it'll do good service. Make it fast," he added to
7234  the men. "Put on a couple of strong gaskets for stoppers. Come on, Tab;
7235  I don't want another ducking."
7236  
7237  They went aft to the cockpit, and the captain started to go below.
7238  
7239  "I'll just take another look at that glass," he said. "It's well to keep
7240  a"--
7241  
7242  "Look!" cried Jerry suddenly, seizing him by the arm, and pointing away
7243  to the southward.
7244  
7245  Jack's eyes followed the mate's arm. Afar off on the gloomy horizon, the
7246  black sea below and the gray sky above were in one place welded together
7247  by a wall of impenetrable haze. It was not much more than a spot, but
7248  Jack at a glance took in its full significance, and knew that before the
7249  Merle was a struggle that would try her strength and his seamanship to
7250  the very utmost. He opened his mouth to speak, and closed his lips
7251  firmly without a word. He looked a moment at the inky mist, and then
7252  dashed below. In a couple of minutes he reappeared with a grim look on
7253  his usually genial face.
7254  
7255  "Jerry," he said hurriedly, "I've been down and tried the storm-card on
7256  the chart. If we keep on as she's going, we'll fetch up plumb in the
7257  centre of this mess. The Merle wouldn't live there half an hour."
7258  
7259  "Well?" questioned Jerry. His face was sober, and had about it a
7260  suggestion of a big, serious dog that watches its troubled master. "What
7261  can we do?"
7262  
7263  "There is only one thing to do," Jack responded quickly, but with
7264  absolute decision. "The centre bears southwesterly,--that's why our
7265  wind's hauled 'round. We've got to put about and run into the heart of
7266  that greasy streak yonder. It'll be a tough job, but not so bad as if we
7267  were farther westward. When we get the wind westerly, we'll lay to. If
7268  we do anything else, we'll be swept into the centre, sure's fate."
7269  
7270  "Can't we run it out?" Jerry asked desperately. "It'll be tremendous!
7271  That blow we had coming over'll be pale beside it. Think, man!"
7272  
7273  "I have," Jack said shortly. "Ready 'bout ship!" he shouted.
7274  
7275  The men sprang to their places, although Jack could see that they threw
7276  swift glances of surprise at him as they did so. The evidence, slight as
7277  it was, that he was acting alone, and that he must see farther and more
7278  wisely than the men under him, accustomed as they were to the sea,
7279  imparted a new ring of command to his voice as he gave the necessary
7280  orders. With some difficulty and with much uproar of booming canvas and
7281  slatting ropes, the schooner came about, and Jack had her headed
7282  straight for the black spot on the horizon.
7283  
7284  Jack hurried on preparations for the storm before them. He had sail
7285  taken in and double-reefed; the "spitfire" jib set in place of the
7286  larger forestaysail, and tarpaulins battened over the skylights. He put
7287  the yacht as completely as possible in heavy-weather trim, to meet the
7288  gale scudding along over the black sea toward them.
7289  
7290  He was none too soon, for the storm was not long in coming. The gray sky
7291  above the yacht grew darker and darker, the sea about her more and more
7292  "cobbly." The wind freshened rapidly, and veered more toward the west.
7293  The Merle sailed on gallantly, the green waves breaking against her
7294  weather shoulder, and the spindrift flying down the decks as she
7295  slashed her way to windward. The tops of the great seas, as they heaved
7296  themselves skyward, were snatched off by the gale, and sped in white
7297  sheets down the wind.
7298  
7299  Jack was standing in the cockpit with Jerry. He was watching the weather
7300  narrowly, and now and then, with a brief word or two, gave the
7301  steersmen--for the wheel needed two of them--a command or a warning. The
7302  force of the gale so increased that at the end of an hour and a half the
7303  mainsail, though triple-reefed, was got down and furled, and the
7304  forestaysail, which had been unbent to give place to the spitfire, was
7305  set on the boom as a trysail.
7306  
7307  It had come on to rain, and the big drops were driven along almost in
7308  horizontal lines. When they struck the face Jack felt as if he had been
7309  pelted with hailstones. Mixed with the flying spindrift they filled the
7310  air as if with a mist, blinding and fierce.
7311  
7312  Suddenly, as the yacht was dipping into the trough of a long sea, a
7313  strong gust listed her over so that aft the green water rose on the
7314  decks to within a fathom of the cockpit combings. A sharp report burst
7315  out above all the roaring of the wind and the multitudinous clamor of
7316  the waters. Jack looked up to see the trysail streaming out in tattered
7317  ribbons, writhing and twisting like pale snakes in mad fury. The sight
7318  inflamed him like a personal insult flung at him by the storm. He broke
7319  out with a cry, and with a great oath swore he would see the Merle
7320  through in spite of everything.
7321  
7322  "Tab," he shouted in the mate's ear, "get along forward on that
7323  sea-anchor! Stand by to launch it. We don't want any more of this!"
7324  
7325  He saw Jerry gather the port watch,--for all the men had been on deck
7326  for two hours past, clinging to whatever was nearest and alternately
7327  watching the storm and the captain,--and with them scrabble forward,
7328  making way by the help of whatever could be grasped. Their difficulty in
7329  getting forward was to Jack like a sudden realization of the danger they
7330  were in, and made him for the moment think of the men, whereas he had
7331  before been conscious of nothing but of the yacht herself. He saw the
7332  men gather about the "sea-anchor," swaying and pitching with the motion
7333  of the bow, and Jerry turn to look for his signal. The yacht was
7334  carrying such a strong lee-helm that the steersmen could not keep her
7335  head to the wind, and Jack shouted and gesticulated frantically to Jerry
7336  to get down the storm-jib, while at the same time he ordered the
7337  starboard watch to unstop the mainsail. He was in deadly fear lest the
7338  vessel should get clean broadside to the wind and that the decks would
7339  be swept.
7340  
7341  "Unstop the mainsail!" he roared. "Show the peak! Douse the jib!"
7342  
7343  Again he motioned to Jerry, knowing that his voice would not be heard
7344  forward. He saw Tab pause a moment, and then wave his arm in reply. To
7345  his utter dismay, however, he saw the mate and the men with him stoop,
7346  get hold of the "sea-anchor," and, tugging and stumbling, begin to haul
7347  it up to the weather side. It flashed on Jack that his gestures had been
7348  misunderstood, and his order to get down the jib mistaken for a command
7349  to launch the "anchor." With a sickening plunge the Merle at that moment
7350  coasted down a mighty wave, fell off, and lay broadside to the seas. For
7351  a second he felt as if everything was lost.
7352  
7353  "Smartly!" he roared to the starboard watch, who were working for their
7354  lives upon the main-boom.
7355  
7356  He gave them one glance, and started to rush forward, running recklessly
7357  along, and feeling for his sheath-knife as he went. A quick lurch of the
7358  yacht to port flung him off his feet, and shot him forward and to his
7359  right. He instinctively flung out his hand, and clutched something
7360  metallic.
7361  
7362  "'Ware water!" he mumbled, half stunned.
7363  
7364  A green shadow curled over him. There was a crashing roar to leeward. He
7365  felt the yacht stagger and tremble, and suddenly and with an odd mental
7366  twist he remembered vividly an earthquake shock he had once felt at
7367  Patras. The shadow disappeared, a little water came slap! on his oilskin
7368  jacket between the shoulders. The rest of the wave--tons and tons of
7369  green water--had curled itself over him, and crashed on the decks to
7370  leeward.
7371  
7372  He got to his feet unsteadily, and with a queer singing in his ears ran
7373  forward. He threw a quick look to port as he ran. The force of the sea
7374  had evidently been heaviest amidships, for he saw that for thirty feet
7375  on the lee beam the rail had been burst out between the fore and main
7376  rigging; two boats were gone, and the skylights, broken, yawned blackly.
7377  Jack groaned inwardly, but did not stop. Pitching and staggering, he
7378  made his way to the foremast. A sudden fling of the yacht threatened to
7379  make him, as he afterward put it, "overshoot the mark" and tumble past
7380  the halyards. Fortunately, however, he checked himself by catching at
7381  the foretopsail-clewline as he was being pitched by, and he clung to it
7382  desperately. He laid hold of the spitfire halyard. One quick glance at
7383  the turns about the pin in the rack told him how much time he should
7384  save by cutting the rope, and with a swift backdrawing of the sharp
7385  sheath-knife he severed it. The fall of the halyard flew up aloft,
7386  playfully dealing him a smart rap on the chin as it went; the sail ran
7387  down in thunder, and blew away in shreds. The Merle began to rise, and
7388  Jack felt a thrill of joyful relief to see that she was coming up into
7389  the wind. The men aft had showed the peak of the mainsail, and the
7390  schooner was feeling its effects.
7391  
7392  A few yards forward, Jerry and the port watch were still toiling over
7393  the "sea-anchor." Twice they had tried to set it in position for
7394  launching, and each time wind and sea had overmastered them. Jack, in an
7395  agony lest the structure should be launched before the yacht was laid
7396  about on the other tack, or at least so near the wind that the awkward
7397  contrivance could be got over the bows to port, stumbled forward
7398  shouting.
7399  
7400  "To port!" he roared. "Get it over to port!"
7401  
7402  He gripped Jerry by the arm.
7403  
7404  "The wrong tack!" he bellowed in the mate's ear. "Run it over to
7405  leeward, and put it over when I wave my arm. Watch sharp!"
7406  
7407  "Aye!" shouted Tab, but Jack was already gone.
7408  
7409  Castleport stumbled aft much as he had gone forward, now climbing
7410  laboriously up hill, now leaning back and struggling to keep himself
7411  from rushing headlong down the sloping deck with an impetus that would
7412  have carried him overboard. When he reached the cockpit, he dropped
7413  inside almost spent.
7414  
7415  "Back the helm every time she rises!" he called to the men at the wheel.
7416  "We want her to fall over!"
7417  
7418  "Aye, aye, sir."
7419  
7420  "Now, then,--over with her!" he cried, as the yacht rose.
7421  
7422  The men gave her all they dared. The effect was imperceptible.
7423  
7424  "Hold her!" shouted Jack.
7425  
7426  At the risk of their lives, the two helmsmen held her as the schooner
7427  slid down the big slope of the wave, shivering as she went. As she rose,
7428  the captain, with a laughing heart, saw that she would make it. He tore
7429  off his "sou'-wester," and waved it frantically to Tab forward. Jerry
7430  threw up his arm in reply; the big "sea-anchor" rose from the deck, and
7431  went out on the port side.
7432  
7433  "Helm amidships!" sang out Jack.
7434  
7435  "Aye, aye, sir."
7436  
7437  The Merle began to drift back.
7438  
7439  "Watch along!" the captain roared again. "Gaskets on the mainsail!"
7440  
7441  The starboard watch began to wrestle with the heavy canvas which they
7442  had partially freed from its bonds so short a time before. The sail was
7443  made snug, and the Merle dragged back on her "anchor," and though she
7444  plunged and tugged, pitched and rolled, still kept her sharp nose to the
7445  wind. Through the mist of the stinging brine which the wind drove down
7446  the decks in sheets, the captain saw the hands forward pay out some
7447  forty fathoms of scope, and then, man by man, work their way aft.
7448  
7449  "I'm awfully sorry I--I made such a mess," Tab shouted in the captain's
7450  ear as he reached him.
7451  
7452  "It's all right," returned Jack, aglow with a wild exultation. "It's all
7453  right! No matter."
7454  
7455  The ominous belt of opaque mist which they had so shortly before seen on
7456  the horizon was now all about them. The Merle and her crew were
7457  enveloped in a shroud of rushing rain. It drove before the blast in
7458  incredible torrents, and with a force that made them catch their breaths
7459  chokingly whenever they faced it. The seas increased to frightful size.
7460  Even to the sailors, bred on the sea, it seemed hardly possible that
7461  the schooner could live in such surges. The cockpit, although
7462  self-bailing, was kept flooded; in it the water, sloshing about with the
7463  motion of the schooner, was as high as the transoms. The uproar of the
7464  wind, singing on the ropes strung by its own force to tautness, was like
7465  the shrieking of an immense and untuned harp. The crash of the waves
7466  sounded like a continuous cannonade all about the yacht. The mingling of
7467  sea and air produced a vertigo, as if everything was resolving again
7468  into its original chaos. Yet in the midst of it all Jack felt his blood
7469  sing in his veins with pure joy of the battle.
7470  
7471  Suddenly the captain remembered the broken skylights. He splashed out of
7472  the cockpit, where he stood almost waist-deep in the jumping water,
7473  steadied himself by the combings, and started forward.
7474  
7475  "Pumps!" he shouted. "Come!"
7476  
7477  He waved his arm to the men, and the yellow-clad figures detached
7478  themselves in the mist and blurring rain from the points of vantage to
7479  which they had clung, and dumb, obedient, followed him.
7480  
7481  The pumps were just abaft the foremast, and were of the semi-rotary
7482  sort. The bars were fitted, and two of the men, swinging themselves
7483  back and forth, back and forth, with a dull and dreary monotony, began
7484  pumping as if they had become parts of a machine. A steady flow of water
7485  came from the waste-pipe in a continuous stream. It spread out over the
7486  deck to port and to starboard as the yacht swayed. It was full of
7487  bubbles and flecks of froth, and was a sickly yellow in hue.
7488  
7489  Jack set the rest of the men to stretch new tarpaulins over the gaping
7490  skylights, and then he went below to look at the glass. Drenched,
7491  bruised, cold from his long fight with the storm and the hours which had
7492  gone by without his having had food, he found himself, now that for the
7493  moment action was not imperative, seized with a sort of terror at the
7494  perils he had gone through. The instant reflection that worse might be
7495  yet to come restored his courage. He could face whatever might befall as
7496  long as he might act.
7497  
7498  The sight which met him in the once trig cabin was sufficiently
7499  dispiriting. A thin sheet of water swashed softly about over the Turkish
7500  carpet. It chuckled in dark places as if sentient and fully aware of the
7501  impropriety of its being there. A locker door had burst open, and was
7502  banging maddeningly. Farther forward, in the dark staterooms, similar
7503  noises could be heard, with sounds which suggested that all sorts of
7504  small things were being flung about. Everything was sopped with
7505  sea-water and drenched by the beating rain: the transom-cushions, two of
7506  which were skating about the cabin with the wicker deck-chairs; the
7507  books on their shelves; the lockers, the mirrors, the sheathing, down
7508  which large drops ran in dizzying zigzags,--in short, everything. The
7509  sight gave Jack a feeling of discouragement worse than anything on
7510  deck--even the tearing away of the bulwarks--had been able to produce.
7511  He felt as if the cruel old ocean were mouthing the schooner as a beast
7512  breaks the bones of its prey before devouring it. He drew in his breath
7513  with fierce resolution, all his combative spirit aroused to fight to the
7514  last gasp, and made his stumbling way to the barometer. He steadied it
7515  with his hand, and read it. It stood at 27.04. This was a drop of only
7516  .05 since his last observation, and the captain's face cleared a little.
7517  If the glass had practically stopped falling, as apparently it had, the
7518  hardest part of the gale would come soon, and be speedily over. The old
7519  weather saw came into his head,--
7520  
7521  
7522       Long foretold, long last;
7523       Short notice, soon past.
7524  
7525  
7526  The relief, slight as it was, affected him so strongly that he almost
7527  smiled. He reflected that the Merle was as well prepared to meet it as
7528  under the circumstances she could be, and he had no real doubt of her
7529  ability to ride it out, unless some unexpected accident disabled the
7530  "sea-anchor."
7531  
7532  When he came on deck he was greeted by Tab, who had taken charge in his
7533  absence, and who asked eagerly the state of the glass. Jack told him,
7534  and drawing him into the companionway, where they could escape the wind
7535  enough to talk, he added his reasons for thinking that a short time
7536  might see them through the worst.
7537  
7538  "How are things below?" asked the mate.
7539  
7540  "Look!" the captain answered, with a sweep of his hand.
7541  
7542  Tab bent down and peered into the dismantled cabin.
7543  
7544  "The devil!" he cried in dismay.
7545  
7546  "Precisely--but it might be worse," returned Jack; "but by George, Tab!"
7547  he burst out with sudden vehemence, "I--I'm glad I haven't got all this
7548  to do over again. You don't know--can't imagine the strain of this sort
7549  of thing."
7550  
7551  "Does your conscience get up like a cat with the wind?" laughed Jerry.
7552  
7553  "No, Tab," Jack answered soberly, "but the men, you know, and thinking I
7554  took them into this when I'd no right to. Oh, rot! No matter, only I'm
7555  jolly glad I ran off with the Merle before I realized all this. I
7556  couldn't bring myself to do it again for"--
7557  
7558  "Come on deck, Jacko," Tab said, after a brief silence in which with
7559  eyes cast down awkwardly he had waited for the captain to continue. "I
7560  know how you feel, but thank the Lord there's work to be done, and we'll
7561  fight through all right. Besides, Gonzague's forward getting a ration of
7562  some sort. We can't afford to miss that."
7563  
7564  He put out his hand, and Jack grasped it appreciatively, with a
7565  half-conscious thanksgiving for the comfort of a friend.
7566  
7567  "Right you are!" the captain said heartily. "We're both of us ready for
7568  a feed, I fancy."
7569  
7570  And out into the storm they went again, buoyant and ready.

7577  Chapter Seventeen
7578  
7579  FACING THE MUSIC
7580  
7581  
7582  "Well," Tab said, "I'll see you as far as the door for fear you'll bolt.
7583  You're a sight nearer funking than I ever saw you, Jacko. You must have
7584  your nerve with you if you don't want to come out of the little end of
7585  the horn."
7586  
7587  "I feel small enough to go through it," Jack retorted.
7588  
7589  "Oh, that's all right. Just take a brace, and"--
7590  
7591  "Humph!" snorted the captain. "It's all well enough for you to snoozle
7592  round and give me advice, but if you had to face Uncle Randolph
7593  yourself, you wouldn't be so chipper, let me tell you!"
7594  
7595  The young men were crossing Atlantic Avenue not far from the East Boston
7596  Ferry. They had at last, sea-weary and glad of land, made harbor on the
7597  previous evening. Jack had hardly waited for the anchor to be down
7598  before he had sent off in haste for his European letters, intrusting the
7599  messenger to post a voluminous epistle on which he had written
7600  industriously at intervals all the way over; and for half the night he
7601  had read and reread Katrine's missives, giving Jerry tantalizing bits
7602  now and then, with messages from Mrs. Fairhew enjoining him not again to
7603  aid and abet Jack in any nefarious schemes. In the morning the crew had
7604  been paid off generously, and given passages on the City of Rockland.
7605  Then Gonzague had been left in charge of the yacht, and now, with
7606  feelings curiously mixed, the captain was bound for the office of his
7607  uncle for the inevitable reckoning with the owner of the stolen Merle.
7608  
7609  It was a bright, sharp morning, without a cloud in the sky. The air had
7610  a clean crispness which went to the head like wine. The streets were
7611  thronged and noisy. Heavy trucks rolled past the pair like batteries
7612  moving into action; the Elevated thundered overhead with its rumbling
7613  screech. The teamsters shouted profanely at their straining horses; a
7614  fat policeman at the crowded crossing waved his arms like semaphores,
7615  now holding up the traffic and again with commanding gesture sweeping it
7616  along. The shrill voices of the newsboys rang out in mechanical
7617  iteration of the leading sensations of the morning journals.
7618  
7619  "Oh," cried Tab, as they walked briskly up State Street, "how good it
7620  is, isn't it, Jacko?"
7621  
7622  Jack was too much absorbed in the interview before him to do more than
7623  nod mechanically. He could not at the moment bring himself up to the gay
7624  mood of his friend.
7625  
7626  "There's no place like it after all," Jerry ran on, his honest, homely
7627  face aglow with delight. "My word, you may talk about Italy and all the
7628  rest of it till the crack of doom, but they can't hold a candle to good
7629  old Boston! Blest if this isn't the best part of the whole cruise!"
7630  
7631  "Think so, do you?" asked Jack dryly. "It's funny, but the very reverse
7632  was in my head. What the deuce," he burst out, "what the deuce am I
7633  going to tell the President anyway?"
7634  
7635  "Oh, just give him the yarn off the reel," returned Tab, as if it were
7636  all the simplest thing in the world. "You've got the log with you,
7637  and--I say, do look at those pigeons! Aren't they jolly! Come, brace
7638  up!"
7639  
7640  "Oh, yes," said Jack. "Brace up, of course--in the very mouth of the
7641  lion's lair. Here's the building,--we're just about seventy feet under
7642  Uncle Randolph's den. Brace up! The very thing, of course! So glad you
7643  suggested it!"
7644  
7645  "Now, Jacko," protested Jerry, "you mustn't take things this way. Do
7646  put some spirit into it. I'll leave you here; but if you want, I'll face
7647  the music with you."
7648  
7649  "No, thank you," his friend said gravely; "I'll take the medicine
7650  alone."
7651  
7652  "Well, that's what we decided last night when we threshed things out. Go
7653  ahead. Bring the remains round to lunch, though. The Roundheads at one.
7654  It's eleven now, and you've got two hours for the job of placating the
7655  president. Come sure; for I shall be in a stew till I know how you two
7656  get on together."
7657  
7658  "All right," Jack responded dispiritedly.
7659  
7660  "Good luck," Jerry said, stretching out his hand.
7661  
7662  "Thank you," Jack returned, giving Tab a hearty grasp. "So long."
7663  
7664  "One o'clock," Jerry repeated; and with a buoyant wave of the hand, he
7665  went on his way up State Street.
7666  
7667  "Suppose he'll weep when he sees the Frog Pond," muttered Jack to
7668  himself with a wan smile. "Wish I felt half as chipper."
7669  
7670  He went to the elevator, and pressed the electric button. The big cage
7671  came down, the boy clashed the door, and Jack went in as he might have
7672  mounted the steps to a scaffold.
7673  
7674  "Mr. Drake's," he said briefly, moistening his lips, and wondering why
7675  they seemed so stiff and dry.
7676  
7677  Deposited on the proper floor, he tucked the brown log-book more tightly
7678  under his arm, and approached his uncle's office.
7679  
7680  "I must have time," he said to himself. "I haven't thought this business
7681  out for a cent."
7682  
7683  He turned on his heel, and walked slowly down the marble-flagged
7684  corridor past the glazed doors of half a dozen offices. Then he stopped
7685  with sudden resolution.
7686  
7687  "Damn it! Be a man!" he adjured himself. "This won't do."
7688  
7689  He walked resolutely up to the door, and entered his uncle's outer
7690  office. A typewriter was clicking busily at one desk, and various clerks
7691  were scratching away assiduously. Several people were seated about,
7692  evidently waiting to speak with Mr. Drake. Even as Jack entered, the
7693  door opened, and a man came out from the inner room. The head clerk
7694  nodded to Jack, but regarded him curiously.
7695  
7696  "How do you do, Mr. Castleport?" he said.
7697  
7698  "Can I see my uncle?" Jack asked, returning his salutation, and he added
7699  to himself, "He knows all about the Merle. I can tell by his looks."
7700  
7701  "He's pretty busy this morning," the clerk answered, "but I'll tell him
7702  you're here. Of course he'll see you as soon as he can."
7703  
7704  Jack took a seat and waited until the next man came out of the inner
7705  office. Then the head clerk went in, and in a moment returned with a
7706  queer look on his face. "Mr. Drake says these men are here by
7707  appointment," he reported, "and he cannot see you till they are gone."
7708  
7709  "All right," Jack answered, reflecting ruefully that he was not
7710  accustomed to be thus kept waiting in his uncle's office. "I am in no
7711  hurry."
7712  
7713  He settled himself in his chair, feeling that he could have borne
7714  anything better than this delay, and half tempted now to give it up, and
7715  beat a retreat. He saw one man after another go into the inner room, and
7716  after a time return and go away. He crossed and recrossed his legs with
7717  an impatient feeling that he had never sat in so uncomfortable a chair.
7718  He tried to beguile the time by reading the log, but first he opened to
7719  the account of the lifting of the Merle, and then to the story of how
7720  her bulwarks were torn away by the storm. He fell to thinking how good
7721  Uncle Randolph had always been to him, and every minute felt more and
7722  more like a wretch for having left the old gentleman stranded at North
7723  Haven. The time grew longer and longer, and every moment more
7724  intolerable as the second hour began to drag its slow length after the
7725  first. Then he noticed that only one man remained to delay his
7726  interview, and so completely was he demoralized that he felt that he
7727  would have given anything in the world to be excused from the trial
7728  before him. It seemed to him that the last man but one did his business,
7729  whatever it was, in an amazingly short time; and he all but bolted when
7730  the last went to his appointment. If he could get away and think things
7731  over once more, he might perhaps be able to devise some sort of excuse
7732  more plausible than anything he had to offer; and he all but started to
7733  his feet to fly when the door opened to let out the only visitor who had
7734  stood between him and the dreaded encounter with the president.
7735  
7736  "Mr. Drake will see you now, sir," said the office boy.
7737  
7738  Jack got to his feet as if by automatic action, and felt them drag him
7739  forward against his will. Another instant, and the door had closed
7740  behind him; he stood in the inner office. With a tremendous effort--an
7741  effort which was almost physical--to pull himself together, he looked up
7742  at his uncle.
7743  
7744  He saw a slight gentleman, dressed in a well-fitting suit of gray,
7745  looking out of one of the windows with his back to the door. The office
7746  was high enough to command a view of the harbor, shining blue in the sun
7747  beyond the clusters of roofs and chimneys. Mr. Drake stood for a moment
7748  as if examining the view for the first time, while Jack wondered whether
7749  this unconsciousness of his presence was real, or was of a piece with
7750  the infliction of the long wait. Then the President turned to him, and
7751  bowed formally, as if to a stranger. His face wore a curious look of
7752  weariness and patience which somehow reminded Jack of his father. The
7753  high forehead was wrinkled with a line or two that Jack did not
7754  remember, and the curly hair was surely more thickly streaked with gray.
7755  
7756  "Well, sir?" Mr. Drake said in a tone hard and even.
7757  
7758  "Well, Uncle Randolph," said Jack, confused, "I--I'm here."
7759  
7760  "So I see," remarked the President. "Is that what you came to say?"
7761  
7762  Jack felt that the interview promised to be even worse than he had
7763  feared. He shuffled his feet uncomfortably, and studied the figures in
7764  the rug. Then he looked up at the face of the elder man, and something
7765  in it smote him to the heart.
7766  
7767  "Uncle Randolph," he said suddenly, "I suppose it's pretty late to say
7768  anything of the sort, but--but something that happened on the way over
7769  made me see that--made me see what a blackguard I'd been to steal the
7770  Merle as I did. I don't think apologies are much good, anyway,
7771  especially after you've had all the fun. It's a good deal like trying to
7772  sneak out of consequences, but I--I really mean most sincerely that I'm
7773  beastly sorry."
7774  
7775  Mr. Drake did not move a muscle of his keen, well-bred face, but into
7776  his eyes came some faint glint of humor which made Jack stop in
7777  confusion.
7778  
7779  "Are you done, sir?" his uncle asked.
7780  
7781  "I'm not quite through, sir," Jack said in a sort of desperate humility.
7782  "I--I--that is"--He floundered for a moment, and then went on with a
7783  rush, "I may as well explain that I'm not sorry one way; that is--I
7784  can't honestly say I wish I hadn't taken the Merle, for I--you know I'm
7785  engaged to Miss Marchfield, and I never could have been except--that is,
7786  unless I'd got over there. I can't be sorry for that."
7787  
7788  "No?" queried Mr. Drake, raising his brows. "You are not thinking,
7789  perhaps, what is the price I have paid for the privilege of
7790  congratulating you on this engagement. I have no son, and from the day
7791  your father died I have made one of you. You deceive me, humiliate me in
7792  the eyes of my guests, make me the joke of my club, leave me high and
7793  dry at North Haven"--
7794  
7795  Sad and sorry as Jack really was, he could not help the impulse that
7796  made him see the chance, and murmur under his breath,--
7797  
7798  "I didn't think anything could be high and dry in the sort of fog we
7799  went off in."
7800  
7801  His uncle gave a slight cough, as if he were strangling an inclination
7802  to laugh, and then went on in the same even voice as before.
7803  
7804  "Of course I can't expect you to have any feeling about the way I felt
7805  about your tricking me, any more than of the anxiety I went through when
7806  the Merle disappeared, and I didn't know whether you were on top of the
7807  sea or under it."
7808  
7809  "I--I never thought of that," stammered Jack, feeling his cheeks grow
7810  hot.
7811  
7812  "No, I suppose not. Nor how I enjoyed the storm you must have been in on
7813  the way home. Lloyd's people sent me word of your giving them the slip
7814  at Plymouth."
7815  
7816  "But they let us," Jack put in eagerly, seizing with avidity at any
7817  point which seemed to afford him a chance to defend himself. "I didn't
7818  think, Uncle Randolph, and I'm afraid I've been a beastly cad to you. I
7819  am sorry to the very bottom of my heart."
7820  
7821  The President took a quick stride forward and clapped one hand on his
7822  nephew's shoulder, while with the other he grasped warmly the hand Jack
7823  put out swiftly to meet him.
7824  
7825  "There, Jack," he said, "that's all I want. You don't know what we old
7826  fools go through worrying over you young ones. Perhaps it's just as well
7827  you don't."
7828  
7829  He gave Jack's hand a vigorous shake, and then turned away to blow his
7830  own nose with equal violence. Jack himself felt hot in the eyes, but he
7831  had no words which seemed adequate to the situation.
7832  
7833  "Sit down," his uncle said, waving him to a chair, and then going to his
7834  desk. He took from a pigeon-hole some letters and papers. "I have
7835  several things to say to you. Mrs. Fairhew writes a very spicy letter
7836  when she wants to."
7837  
7838  "I should think she might, sir. She can be spicy when she talks."
7839  
7840  "She says I didn't know you were grown-up, Jack."
7841  
7842  Jack blushed at the remembrance, vivid and sharp, of his declaration to
7843  Jerry that he would make his uncle realize that he had come to man's
7844  estate.
7845  
7846  "Oh, ho," said Mr. Drake, regarding him keenly, but with humorous eyes,
7847  "you thought so too, did you? Of course you did! Well, I know it now,
7848  and I've been an old fool. I congratulate you, Jack, with all my heart.
7849  If Miss Marchfield is like her mother"--He broke off as if his thought
7850  had got the better of his speech. "If she is all that Mrs. Fairhew says
7851  she is, you have a treasure, my boy. Don't ever run off with her yacht."
7852  
7853  "I never mean to repeat that performance with anybody," Jack declared
7854  stoutly, again shaking hands fervently. "You've always been awfully good
7855  to me, Uncle Randolph, and I've never done anything for you."
7856  
7857  "Hum, perhaps not that you know of," the other replied, with a humorous
7858  lift of his eyebrows; "but we sometimes do good when we think we're
7859  doing harm. Read this."
7860  
7861  He held out a long blue envelope, much stamped and written upon, and
7862  provided with both American and English postage-stamps. Jack knew it at
7863  a glance as the one he had taken from the messenger that foggy night at
7864  North Haven, had found in the pocket of his coat at Nice, and had after
7865  much cogitation remailed at Plymouth. In the upper left-hand corner was
7866  the notice to return to R. B. Tillington, if not delivered in five
7867  days, and the Boston address written in his own hand. He drew out the
7868  letter and read:--
7869  
7870  
7871       MY DEAR DRAKE,--You and I have known the ins and outs of the market
7872       for so many years that we ought to appreciate both the danger of
7873       getting into an unsound stock and the foolishness of letting the
7874       real thing go by for the want of a little courage. I think you are
7875       not likely to have forgotten what Orrington said in the club last
7876       week about Orion Copper, or that I told you I meant to sift that
7877       thing to the very bottom. Well, I have been looking it up with a
7878       microscope ever since. I enclose three or four copies of
7879       letters,--this is all confidential, of course; you would know that
7880       without my saying so, but the thing's too important not to be
7881       particular about. I write to you because I've got to have somebody
7882       share the thing, and I think you can raise the money without
7883       putting anybody on the scent. Besides that, we have always got on
7884       well together, I believe in your luck, and I want somebody to stand
7885       with me in running the whole thing. There's nothing less than
7886       millions in it if we can get control at once. Sell anything,--I'm
7887       selling _everything_ myself,--and get in on the ground floor of
7888       Orion. If I had known just where to hit you, I'd have got you to
7889       town to investigate for yourself; but I've wasted a small fortune
7890       already telegraphing to every damned port on the coast I could
7891       think of. You'll find wires waiting at every place you put into.
7892       Orion's bound to be the coming financial constellation. B. B.,
7893       Mellington, Foster, and two or three others have blundered into it
7894       just by bull luck, but they haven't got enough stock to hurt us if
7895       you'll stand by me.
7896  
7897       Yours for Orion,
7898       R. B. T.
7899  
7900  
7901  Jack read in steadily increasing consternation.
7902  
7903  "Good heavens!" he said. "Did I make you lose the chance? Did you get
7904  the telegrams?"
7905  
7906  "I got them, but they referred me to the letter, and I was too upset
7907  about the Merle to pay much attention. Then I went over to the island,
7908  and stayed there three or four days; so that by the time I did get a
7909  letter--a second one--the whole thing was over."
7910  
7911  "Was that what broke Tillington?" Jack asked, feeling as if his escapade
7912  had destroyed half the financial world.
7913  
7914  "It saved me from going with him," Mr. Drake returned, with a smile.
7915  "See here." He extended a lot of newspaper cuttings, and then drew them
7916  back. "Never mind, though," he went on. "There's no need of going into
7917  the particulars. The whole thing was a trap from beginning to end. If
7918  you made a fool of me, Jack, by running off with the Merle, it isn't a
7919  circumstance to the fool I'd have made of myself if I'd got that letter.
7920  If it hadn't been for that perfectly heartless and entirely inexcusable
7921  performance of yours, we'd both of us be beggars at this blessed moment.
7922  We came so near it that I can't read that sign downstairs, 'Beggars and
7923  Peddlers not Allowed,' without thinking how near I was to having it
7924  forbid me my own office."
7925  
7926  "Do you really mean it, Uncle Randolph?" Jack asked half breathlessly.
7927  
7928  "I do mean it, my boy, though I'm afraid the moral of it all's pretty
7929  crooked. I had been led in with a cleverness that gives me cold shivers.
7930  That talk at the club that I'd heard as if by accident had all been
7931  planned out, and so on for a lot more things I won't go into.
7932  Mellington's blown his brains out, and poor old Foster isn't up to
7933  anything but cadging for drinks at the club, and telling how he was
7934  roped in when he was drunk, poor old fellow! I was so sure of Orion that
7935  I'd have put in the last dollar of yours or mine I could have laid
7936  hands on! I feel like a humbug when men congratulate me on knowing
7937  enough to keep out of the mess."
7938  
7939  "And I saved you?" cried Jack, bending forward with boyish eagerness.
7940  
7941  "Yes, you rascally jackanapes; but small credit to you!"
7942  
7943  Jack sent the log up into the air, and, bounding to his feet, caught it
7944  as it fell.
7945  
7946  "Whoop!" he shouted. "Oh, how glad I am old Tillington wrote that letter
7947  and I carried it off!"
7948  
7949  The President laughed with responsive joyousness, but reminded his
7950  ebullient nephew that there were clerks in the other room. He began to
7951  ask questions about the voyage, but the clock struck one and Jack
7952  recalled the fact that Taberman was waiting for him at the Roundheads,
7953  and probably was on tenterhooks for his news.
7954  
7955  "You'll come to luncheon, won't you, sir?" he pleaded.
7956  
7957  "That'll look well," retorted his uncle with humorous derision.
7958  "Everybody knows about your running off with the Merle--Bardale couldn't
7959  hold his tongue--and I shall be accused of condoning a felony."
7960  
7961  Nevertheless they set out arm in arm for the club, and as they went the
7962  President informed his secretary that he should not be back at the
7963  office that afternoon.
7964  
7965  "We shall want to run over the log," he explained to Jack as they waited
7966  for the elevator. "I've no doubt it will make you blush to have me read
7967  it, but I'm going to."
7968  
7969  "I brought it for you," Jack answered, with a grin of pure joy. "Do you
7970  mind waiting a minute, while I send a cable to Katrine? She was awfully
7971  anxious to know how hard you'd be on me."
7972  
7973  "Now she'll think I've no backbone at all. Well, when you played me that
7974  trick, Jack, I felt terribly old and alone; but I think I am a little
7975  bit younger now you're back, and prepared to behave yourself."
7976  
7977  "Wait till you've read the log," laughed Jack, "and you'll think you're
7978  in your teens!"

7987  EPILUDE
7988  
7989  
7990  Jack, who had been dining at Mrs. Fairhew's, was taking leave of Katrine
7991  one evening a few weeks before the day set for the wedding. The farewell
7992  had all the characteristic deliberateness which has marked the unwilling
7993  separation of engaged couples from time immemorial, and was to-night
7994  prolonged more than usual by his teasing refusal to answer a question.
7995  
7996  "Do tell me what the great secret is between you and Mr. Drake, Jack,"
7997  she begged. "I think you are perfectly horrid!"
7998  
7999  He looked down into her face and laughed softly.
8000  
8001  "You're not," he returned. "You're perfectly stunning to-night."
8002  
8003  "Of course I am," she retorted, laughing and pouting; "but you can't put
8004  me off with a compliment. If you hadn't meant to tell me, you wouldn't
8005  have spoken about it at all; and I think you've teased me enough. What
8006  is it about the President and you?"
8007  
8008  She touched the tips of her fingers to his cravat, as if she were
8009  straightening it, whereas she was probably only exerting instinctively
8010  her privilege of proprietorship in Jack and his belongings.
8011  
8012  "Well," he laughed, "you have borne it beautifully, and I've had you
8013  crazy with curiosity till I don't dare put off telling you. But you'll
8014  probably lie awake half the night thinking about it."
8015  
8016  "That depends upon how important it is."
8017  
8018  "I expect to be paid for telling you," he declared with a look that made
8019  her flush.
8020  
8021  "I should think you might be generous enough to tell me for nothing,"
8022  she responded; but her dimples deepened.
8023  
8024  He stooped forward quickly, and kissed her. Then he took both her hands
8025  in his, and stood caressing them while he went on.
8026  
8027  "The news is this," he said. "We've got to change our plans for the
8028  wedding journey from stem to stern."
8029  
8030  "Why, Jack! What do you mean?"
8031  
8032  "It's a fact, dear," he went on, assuming an expression of profound
8033  regret which was too obviously artificial to be depressing.
8034  
8035  "But why?"
8036  
8037  "Because--Are you ready for a great shock? Wouldn't you like me to
8038  support you in case you couldn't bear it?"
8039  
8040  "Don't be silly," she urged, with an adorable smile. "Because what?"
8041  
8042  "Because Uncle Randolph has given us the Merle as a wedding present. He
8043  told me this afternoon, so that we should have time to shape our plans
8044  accordingly."
8045  
8046  "Oh, dear Jack!"
8047  
8048  "Splendid of him, isn't it? How would it strike you to have the Merle
8049  sent over and to take a whole year in her on the Mediterranean?"
8050  
8051  "Oh, that would be too beautiful!" Katrine cried.
8052  
8053  She clasped her hands, and looked up at him with loving brave eyes. Her
8054  first thought was of his pleasure, and instantly followed the reflection
8055  that she was making her first sacrifice; for her quick mind foresaw that
8056  Jack on a yacht, with duties in which he delighted, would probably be
8057  less wholly hers than in the travel by land which they had arranged. She
8058  smiled wonderfully, and for the first time in their engagement she bent
8059  forward of her own accord, and offered him her lips.

8301  your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
8302  the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

8304  providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
8305  receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
8306  is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
8307  opportunities to fix the problem.

8317  law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
8318  interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
8319  the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
8320  provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
8321  
8322  1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
8323  trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

8326  promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
8327  harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,

8330  work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any

8334  Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
8335  
8336  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
8337  electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
8338  including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
8339  because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
8340  people in all walks of life.
8341  
8342  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
8343  assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
8344  goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
8345  remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
8346  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
8347  and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

8379  Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
8380  Literary Archive Foundation
8381  
8382  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
8383  spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
8384  increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
8385  freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
8386  array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
8387  ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
8388  status with the IRS.
8389  
8390  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
8391  charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
8392  States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
8393  considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
8394  with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
8395  where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
8396  SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
8397  particular state visit http://pglaf.org
8398  
8399  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
8400  have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
8401  against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
8402  approach us with offers to donate.
8403  
8404  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
8405  any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
8406  outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
8407  
8408  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
8409  methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
8410  ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

8414  Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
8415  works.
8416  
8417  Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
8418  concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
8419  with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
8420  Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
8421  
8422  
8423  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
8424  editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
8425  unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
8426  keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
8427

8429  Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

8435  Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
