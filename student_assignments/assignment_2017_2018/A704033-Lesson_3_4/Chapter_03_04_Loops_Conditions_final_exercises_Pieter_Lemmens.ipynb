The song's simple lyrics are as follows: \"99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.\" The same verse is repeated, each time with one fewer bottle. The song is completed when the singer or singers reach zero. Your task here is to write a Python code block capable of generating all the verses of the song. Use a `counter` integer variable and a `while` loop. Make sure that your loop will come to an end and that the inflection of the word bottle is adapted to the counter!\n"

    "Ex. 6: The third person singular verb form in English is distinguished by the suffix -s, which is added to the stem of the infinitive form: run -> runs. A simple set of rules can be given as follows: \"If the verb ends in y, remove it and add ies. If the verb ends in o, ch, s, sh, x or z, add es. By default just add s.\" Your task in this exercise is to write a code block which given a verb in infinitive form, prints its third person singular form. Test your function with words like \"try\", \"brush\", \"run\" and \"fix\". Can you think of verbs for which your code doesn't work? Check out the string method `.endswith()` online!\n"

    "- Ex. 7: ROT13, or Caesar cipher, is a way to encode secret messages in cryptography. The name comes from Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals. ROT13 (\"rotate by 13 places\") is a widely used example of a Caesar cipher. The idea is to rotate or augment the position of each character in the alphabet with thirteen places, wrapping back to the beginning if necessary. Because the alphabet has 26 characters, the encryption is symmetric: you can map the first 13 to the last 13, and the last 13 to the first 13. Your task in this exercise is to implement an encoder/decoder of ROT13. For this, you will need to create a list containing each letter in the (lowercase) roman alphabet. Next, you create a `rot13_dict` that maps each character to its corresponding letter 13 letters up or down the alphabet. Any character that is not in the alphabet (such as spaces and punctuation marks) should be left as-is. Once you're done, you will be able to read the following secret message: `\"Pnrfne pvcure? V zhpu cersre Pnrfne fnynq!\"` (Hint: you can use `.index()` to retrieve the position of an item in a list)"
