Often these will be 'syntax errors' that signal that something is wrong with the form of your code (i.e. a `SyntaxError` like the one thrown in the previous exercise). There are also 'runtime errors' that signal that your code was in itself formally correct, but that something went wrong during the code's execution. A good example is the `ZeroDivisionError`. Try to make Python throw such a ZeroDivisionError! (Hint: it has to do with the fact that you cannot divide a number by zero)"
