Postmortem 2017-2018

Issues and action next year:
- Bring laptop: this year we provided laptops the first class for those who
needed it. State very clearly next year that a laptop is required both for the
master and in the course specification.

- Assignments:
Decided to correct, feedback and grade assignments because the students did
not voluntary make exercises. Originally the plan was to not correct 
assigments and make them voluntary. Maybe next year do not grade as planned. 
Disadvantage of not grading is the follow-up of students.

- Grading:
Assignments are graded, but because the course-spec says 100% to
project the assignment count to extra credit. If we were to stick to plan and
not grade or correct assignments we would open us up to the possible of source
code plagiarism for the final project.
=> Solution next editions: 80% project, 20% assignments but students need 
to pass on both parts to pass the course. THIS NEEDS TO BE CHANGED IN THE
COURSE DESCRIPTION.

- Final project evaluation:
Plan in a demonstration presentation where student groups present their code
working. 
This avoids dependency hell and local setup (such as platform) issues.
This was not clearly announced in advance.
=> Solution: next time INCORPORATE in the presentation demo in the final 
project ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS HAS TO BE CHANGED IN THE COURSE DESCRIPTION FOR
NEXT EDITION.

- Final project grading:
Put more points than 3/20 on scope. Some students have very good code code but
have a very limited program.
=> have it be 5/20 and make readability 3/20.

- Technical install:
antivirus and antimalware interferes a lot with anaconda. This is your go-to
when any student is experiencing problems.

- Technical webscraping:
The LT3 webpage used as example cannot be reached from eduroam, hence students
cannot follow along in class even if you are on wired network.
=> Solution: Use another website for scraping class.
