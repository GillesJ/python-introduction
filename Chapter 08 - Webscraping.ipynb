    "The web is a giant repository of (textual) information and the need to extract information from it automatically is clear. One very useful application of scripts is for processing online data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is a computer software technique of **extracting information from websites**. This involves 1) fetching the HTML document of a webpage and 2) parsing: the transformation of unstructured data (HTML format) on the web into structured data (database or spreadsheet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has many excellent pre-made software suites (or *libraries*) and is thus ideal for this purpose. Today we will give a few examples using the `requests` library for fetching pages, and the `bs4` (BeautifulSoup) library for parsing HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take these libraries for a spin! Suppose we want to know what LT3 researchers like to write about, by collecting a corpus of paper abstracts from the [LT3 publications page](https://www.lt3.ugent.be/publications/). First, we want to crawl links to individual paper pages, where the abstracts can be found."

    "## Introduction to HTML\n",
    "HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and is the language used to describe (markup) web pages. It is the underlying language to structure web-page content. HTML itself does not determine the way things look â it only helps to classify and structure content. It is your browser's job to receive and process the HTML so they can be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTML Elements\n",
    "A HTML document is a structured representation of content which is subdivided in elements. Elements are the building blocks of a page. HTML tags label pieces of content such as \"heading\", \"paragraph\", \"table\", and so on. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements are identified by âtagsâ, their name.\n",
    "HTML tags usually come in pairs: the opening tag <tagname> and a closing tag with a forward slash for the tagname <\\tagname>.\n",
    "Tags can have an inner text and âattributesâ (named properties):\n",
    "```\n",
    "<tag attribute=âvalueâ>text</tag>\n",
    "\n",
    "Common tags:\n",
    "    <html> â the whole document\n",
    "    <body> â the human-readable part of the web page\n",
    "    <table> â the frame of a table element\n",
    "    <tr> â a row in a table\n",
    "    <td> â a cell of content inside a row\n",
    "    <th> â a table header cell inside a row\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A web page contains of a series of these elements which can be recursively embedded into eachother. Here is an example of a very simple page:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " <!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "        <title>Page Title</title>\n",

    "        <p>My first paragraph.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "    </body>\n",
    "</html> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view the HTML source of any webpage in your browser by right clicking and selecting \"View source\" from the menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTML links\n",
    "HTML links are elements \n",
    "defined with the `<a>` tag. The URL itself the value assigned to the href attribute.\n",
    "```\n",
    "<a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com\">This is a link</a>\n",

We perform an extensive intrinsic evaluation on a Gold Standard set of 50,000 Dutch compounds and a set of 5,000 Dutch compounds belonging to the automotive domain. We also propose a novel methodology for word alignment that makes use of the compound splitter.

      "<p>Quality estimation (QE) and error analysis of machine translation (MT) output remains to be an active area in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research. Many recent efforts focus on machine learning (ML) systems to estimate the MT quality, translation errors, post-editing speed or the post-editing effort. As the accuracy of such ML tasks relies on the availability of corpora, the need for large corpora of machine translations annotated with translation errors and the error annotation guidelines to produce consistent annotations emerges. Building on previous work on translation error taxonomies, we present the SCATE MT error taxonomy, which is hierarchical in nature and builds upon the well-known notions of accuracy and fluency.  In the SCATE annotation framework, we annotate fluency errors on monolingual level in the target text and accuracy errors on bilingual level and link the corresponding source and target text fragments to each other. We also propose a novel method for alignment-based inter-annotator agreement (IAA) analysis and show that this method can be used effectively on large annotation sets. Using the SCATE taxonomy and the guidelines, we build the first corpus of MT errors for the English-Dutch language pair, consisting of statistical machine translation (SMT) and rule-based machine translation (RBMT) errors, which is a valuable resource not only for NLP tasks in this field but also to study the relation of MT errors and post-editing effort in the future. Finally, we analyse the error profiles of the SMT and the RBMT systems used in this study and compare the quality of these two different MT architectures based on the error types.</p>\n",

In this article, we aim to get a better understanding of the differences between human translation and post-editing for newspaper articles.

The present paper reports on a crucial step in creating the corpus, viz. the creation of a part-of-speech tagger for Middle Low German (MLG).

We used this data to compare the types of resources used and the time spent in external resources for forty from-scratch translation sessions (HT) and forty post-editing (PE) sessions of ten master's students of translation (from English into Dutch). We took a closer look at the effect of the usage of external resources on productivity and quality of the final product. The types of resources consulted were comparable for HT and PE, but more time was spent in external resources when translating. Though search strategies seemed to be more successful when translating than when post-editing, the quality of the final product was comparable, and post-editing was faster than regular translation.</p>\n",

      "<p>To keep up with the growing need for translation in today's globalised society, post-editing of machine translation is increasingly being used as an alternative to regular human translation. While presumably faster than human translation, it is still unsure whether the quality of a post-edited text is comparable to the quality of a human translation, especially for general text types. In addition, there is a lack of understanding of the post-editing process, the effort involved, and the attitude of translators towards it. </p>\n",
      "<p>This dissertation contains a comparative analysis of post-editing and human translation by students and professional translators for general text types from English into Dutch. We study process, product, and translators' attitude in detail. </p>\n",
      "<p>We first conducted two pretests with student translators to try possible experimental setups and to develop a translation quality assessment approach suitable for a fine-grained comparative analysis of machine-translated texts, post-edited texts, and human translations. For the main experiment, we examined students and professional translators, using a combination of keystroke logging tools, eye tracking, and surveys. We used both qualitative analyses and advanced statistical analyses (mixed effects models), allowing for a multifaceted analysis.</p>\n",
      "<p>For the process analysis, we looked at translation speed, cognitive processing by means of eye fixations, the usage of external resources and its impact on overall time. For the product analysis, we looked at overall quality, frequent error types, and the impact of using external resources on quality. The attitude analysis contained questions about perceived usefulness, perceived speed, perceived quality of machine translation and post-editing, and the translation method that was perceived as least tiring. One survey was conducted before the experiment, the other after, so we could detect changes in attitude after participation. In two more detailed analyses, we studied the impact of machine translation quality on various types of post-editing effort indicators, and on the post-editing of multi-word units.</p>\n",
      "<p>We found that post-editing is faster than human translation, and that both translation methods lead to products of comparable overall quality. The more detailed error analysis showed that post-editing leads to somewhat better results regarding adequacy, and human translation leads to better results regarding acceptability. The most common errors for both translation methods are meaning shifts, logical problems, and wrong collocations. Fixation data indicated that post-editing was cognitively less demanding than human translation, and that more attention was devoted to the target text than to the source text. We found that fewer resources are consulted during post-editing than during human translation, although the overall time spent in external resources was comparable. The most frequently used external resources were Google Search, concordancers, and dictionaries. Spending more time in external resources, however, did not lead to an increase in quality. Translators indicated that they found machine translation useful, but they preferred human translation and found it more rewarding. Perceptions about speed and quality were mixed. Most participants believed post-editing to be at least as fast and as good as human translation, but barely ever better. We further discovered that different types of post-editing effort indicators were impacted by different types of machine translation errors, with coherence issues, meaning shifts, and grammatical and structural issues having the greatest effect. HTER, though commonly used, does not correlate well with more process-oriented post-editing effort indicators. Regarding the post-editing of multi-word units, we suggest 'contrast with the target language' as a useful new way of classifying multi-word units, as contrastive multi-word units were much harder to post-edit. In addition, we noticed that research strategies for post-editing multi-word units lack efficiency. Consulting external resources did lead to an increased quality of post-edited multi-word units, but a lot of time was spent in external resources when this was not necessary. </p>\n",
      "<p>Interestingly, the differences between human translation and post-editing usually outweighed the differences between students and professionals. Students did cognitively process texts differently, having longer fixation durations on the source text during human translation, and more fixations on the target text during post-editing, whereas professional translators' fixation behaviour remained constant. For the usage of external resources, only the time spent in dictionaries was higher for students than for professional translators, the usage of other resources was comparable. Overall quality was comparable for students and professionals, but professionals made fewer adequacy errors. Deletions were more noticeable for students than for professional translators in both methods of translation, and word sense issues were more noticeable for professional translators than for students when translating from scratch. Surprisingly, professional translators were often more positive about post-editing than students, believing they could produce products of comparable quality with both methods of translation. Students in particular struggled with the cognitive processing of meaning shifts, and they spent more time in pauses than professional translators.</p>\n",
      "<p>Some of the key contributions of this dissertation to the field of translation studies are the fact that we compared students and professional translators, developed a fine-grained translation quality assessment approach, and used a combination of state-of-the-art logging tools and advanced statistical methods. The effects of experience in our study were limited, and we suggest looking at specialisation and translator confidence in future work. Our guidelines for translation quality assessment can be found in the appendix, and contain practical instructions for use with brat, an open-source annotation tool. The experiment described in this dissertation is also the first to integrate Inputlog and CASMACAT, making it possible to include information on external resources in the CASMACAT logging files, which can be added to the CRITT Translation Process Research Database. </p>\n",
      "<p>Moving beyond the methodological contributions, our findings can be integrated in translation teaching, machine translation system development, and translation tool development. Translators need hands-on post-editing experience to get acquainted with common machine translation errors, and students in particular need to be taught successful strategies to spot and solve adequacy issues. Post-editors would greatly benefit from machine translation systems that made fewer coherence errors, meaning shift errors, and grammatical and structural errors.

It is only by studying both processes in many different situations and by comparing findings that we will be able to develop tools and create courses that better suit translators' needs.

      "<p>Readability research has a long and rich tradition, but there has been too little focus on general readability prediction without targeting a specific audience or text genre. Moreover, though NLP-inspired research has focused on adding more complex readability features there is still no consensus on which features contribute most to the prediction. In this article, we investigate in close detail the feasibility of constructing a readability prediction system for English and Dutch generic text using supervised machine learning. Based on readability assessments by both experts<br/>and a crowd, we implement different types of text characteristics ranging from easy-to-compute superficial text characteristics to features requiring a deep linguistic processing, resulting in ten<br/>different feature groups. Both a regression and classification setup are investigated reflecting the two possible readability prediction tasks: scoring individual texts or comparing two texts. We show that going beyond correlation calculations for readability optimization using a wrapper-based genetic algorithm optimization approach is a promising task which provides considerable insights in which feature combinations contribute to the overall readability prediction. Since we also have gold standard information available for those features requiring deep processing we are able to investigate the true upper bound of our Dutch system. Interestingly, we will observe that the performance of our fully-automatic readability prediction pipeline is on par with the pipeline using golden deep syntactic and semantic information.</p>\n",

      "<p>Creating domain ontologies is usually performed by teams of knowledge engineers and domain experts, and is considered to be a time-consuming and difficult task. As a result, scientists have started to develop automatic approaches to ontology learning and population. For the proposed research, we focus on the central subtask of ontology learning, being the hypernym detection task, where the system has to detect hierarchical semantic relationships, i.e. hypernymâhyponym relationships, between domain-specific terms, resulting in a domain-specific taxonomy. We propose in this paper a hybrid approach to automatic taxonomy learning, which combines a data-driven and a knowledge-based component. The data-driven component is composed of a lexico-syntactic pattern-based module, a morpho-syntactic analyzer and a distributional model, whereas the knowledge-based component extracts structured semantic information from the Linked Open Data cloud (DBpedia) and WordNet. The proposed methodology has been applied to three different knowledge domains: viz. food , equipment and science . A thorough quantitative and qualitative evaluation has shown promising results for all considered test domains. In addition, the results show a clear contribution of all different modules to the automatic taxonomy learning task. Although there is still room for improvement for all different modules, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art systems that participated in the SemEval âTaxonomy Extraction Evaluationâ task when it comes to comparing the automatically constructed taxonomy against a manually verified gold standard taxonomy. As all modules are run automatically, the system provides a flexible and domain-independent approach to automatic taxonomy learning and could be an important step in solving the knowledge acquisition bottleneck in ontology learning.</p>\n",

More and more post-editing research is being conducted, yet this research often gives rise to new questions specific to the post-editing process and the consequences of this process (Dillinger, 2014). According to Dillinger (2014), the advancement of technological research tools such as keystroke loggers and eyetrackers revolutionized translation research in that we are now able to look at the translation and post-editing process in more detail, giving rise to more specific questions every day. </p>\n",
      "<p>Whereas the benefit of using post-editing in a technical context has been established (Plitt &amp; Masselot, 2010), the potential benefit of using post-editing for general text types is currently still underresearched, with a few exceptions (Elming, Balling, &amp; Carl, 2014). The present study aims to fill this gap by comparing human translation with post-editing for general texts (newspaper articles), for the English-Dutch language pair. We try to answer the following questions: is post-editing faster than human translation, is there a difference in quality between the product of human translation and the product of post-edited machine translation output, is there a difference in translation units between human translation and post-editing, is post-editing cognitively more demanding than human translation, is the gaze behavior different for post-editing and human translation (Mesa-Lao, 2014), and are more (or other) external resources consulted in human translation than in post-editing? Additionally, we wish to gain a better understanding of the post-editing process itself, by linking our findings back to the quality of the original machine translation output. More specifically, we want to find out whether there is a relationship between the quality of the initial machine translation output and the frequency of consulting the source text, and whether there is a correlation between the quality of the original machine translation output, and the quality of the final product after post-editing. </p>\n",
      "<p>We report on a study with ten master's students of translation who each translated four texts and post-edited four texts. The design was balanced so that we obtained five post-edited versions and five human translations for each text. Students had passed their general translation exam, and had no previous post-editing experience. Texts were newspaper articles with comparable Lexile scores, selected from Newsela. The final text selection was made by identifying common translation problems and looking at the quality of the machine translation output for each text. Before and after the experiment, participants filled out surveys providing us with metadata. By using CasMaCat, a state-of-the-art translator workbench with additional keystroke logging functions and eye-tracking integration, we were able to look into various aspects of the translation and post-editing process: number of fixations on source and target text, average gaze duration on source and target text, number of production units and the number of words within each production unit, time spent on parallel reading and writing activity, and the time needed to translate a segment (with or without pauses longer than 5 seconds). The additional logging with Inputlog, a keystroke logger capable of logging different programs and browser tabs, provides us with information on the external resources consulted during translation. Cognitive load is looke at through the analysis of gaze data and the time spent on parallel activity, with the addition of subjective feelings of cognitive load taken from the surveys. In order to assess and compare the quality of the final products, we applied our two-step translation quality assessment approach (Daems, Macken, &amp; Vandepitte, 2013). This allows us to compare the quality for issues relating to adequacy, as well as issues relating to acceptability.</p>\n",

      "<p>Applications which make use of natural language processing (NLP) are said to benefit more from incorporating a rich model of text meaning than from a basic representation in the form of bag-of-words. This thesis set out to explore the added value of incorporating deep semantic information in two end-user applications that normally rely mostly on superficial and lexical information, viz. readability prediction and aspect-based sentiment analysis. For both applications we apply supervised machine learning techniques and focus on the incorporation of coreference and semantic role information.<br/>To this purpose, we adapted a Dutch coreference resolution system and developed a semantic role labeler for Dutch. We tested the cross-genre robustness of both systems and in a next phase retrained them on a large corpus comprising a variety of text genres. <br/>For the readability prediction task, we first built a general-purpose corpus consisting of a large variety of text genres which was then assessed on readability. Moreover, we proposed an assessment technique which has not previously been used in readability assessment, namely crowdsourcing, and revealed that crowdsourcing is a viable alternative to the more traditional assessment technique of having experts assign labels.<br/>We built the first state-of-the-art classification-based readability prediction system relying on a rich feature space of traditional, lexical, syntactic and shallow semantic features. Furthermore, we enriched this tool by introducing new features based on coreference resolution and semantic role labeling. We then explored the added value of incorporating this deep semantic information by performing two different rounds of experiments. In the first round these features were manually in- or excluded and in the second round joint optimization experiments were performed using a wrapper-based feature selection system based on genetic algorithms. In both setups, we investigated whether there was a difference in performance when these features were derived from gold standard information compared to when they were automatically generated, which allowed us to assess the true upper bound of incorporating this type of information.<br/>Our results revealed that readability classification definitely benefits from the incorporation of semantic information in the form of coreference and semantic role features. More precisely, we found that the best results for both tasks were achieved after jointly optimizing the hyperparameters and semantic features using genetic algorithms. Contrary to our expectations, we observed that our system achieved its best performance when relying on the automatically predicted deep semantic features. This is an interesting result, as our ultimate goal is to predict readability based exclusively on automatically-derived information sources. <br/>For the aspect-based sentiment analysis task, we developed the first Dutch end-to-end system. We therefore collected a corpus of Dutch restaurant reviews and annotated each review with aspect term expressions and polarity. For the creation of our system, we distinguished three individual subtasks: aspect term extraction, aspect category classification and aspect polarity classification. We then investigated the added value of our two semantic information layers in the second subtask of aspect category classification. <br/>In a first setup, we focussed on investigating the added value of performing coreference resolution prior to classification in order to derive which implicit aspect terms (anaphors) could be linked to which explicit aspect terms (antecedents). In these experiments, we explored how the performance of a baseline classifier relying on lexical information alone would benefit from additional semantic information in the form of lexical-semantic and semantic role features. We hypothesized that if coreference resolution was performed prior to classification, more of this semantic information could be derived, i.e. for the implicit aspect terms, which would result in a better performance. In this respect, we optimized our classifier using a wrapper-based approach for feature selection and we compared a setting where we relied on gold-standard anaphor-antecedent pairs to a setting where these had been predicted. <br/>Our results revealed a very moderate performance gain and underlined that incorporating coreference information only proves useful when integrating gold-standard coreference annotations. When coreference relations were derived automatically, this led to an overall decrease in performance because of semantic mismatches. When comparing the semantic role to the lexical-semantic features, it seemed that especially the latter features allow for a better performance.<br/>In a second setup, we investigated how to resolve implicit aspect terms. We compared a setting where gold-standard coreference resolution was used for this purpose to a setting where the implicit aspects were derived from a simple subjectivity heuristic. Our results revealed that using this heuristic results in a better coverage and performance, which means that, overall, it was difficult to find an added value in resolving coreference first. <br/>Does deep semantic information help tip the scales on performance? For Dutch readability prediction, we found that it does, when integrated in a state-of-the-art classifier. By using such information for Dutch aspect-based sentiment analysis, we found that this approach adds weight to the scales, but cannot make them tip.</p>\n",

      "<p>We present a fine-grained scheme for the annotation of polar sentiment in text, that accounts for explicit sentiment (so-called private states), as well as implicit expressions of sentiment (polar facts). Polar expressions are annotated below sentence level and classified according to their subjectivity status. Additionally, they are linked to one or more targets with a specific polar orientation and intensity. Other components of the annotation scheme include source attribution and the identification and classification of expressions that modify polarity. In previous research, little attention has been given to implicit sentiment, which represents a substantial amount of the polar expressions encountered in our data. An English and Dutch corpus of financial newswire, consisting of over 45,000 words each, was annotated using our scheme. A subset of this corpus was used to conduct an inter-annotator agreement study, which demonstrated that the proposed scheme can be used to reliably annotate explicit and implicit sentiment in real-world textual data, making the created corpora a useful resource for sentiment analysis.</p>\n",
