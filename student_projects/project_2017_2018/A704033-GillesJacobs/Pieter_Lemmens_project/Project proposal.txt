Project proposal

With this project I hope to write a program that facilitates acquiring book reviews from Goodreads and LibraryThing for a known book.

- Problem Analysis
	Input
		The user inputs the title of a book (string). The two sites I have chosen to gather data from (for now) are Goodreads and LibraryThing. While LibraryThing offers the more extensive database, Goodreads is generally far more popular and generates more reviews for most books. Data would be acquired in XML format (using the APIs of both websites). I believe the default encoding for both options is utf-8.

	Output
		I expect the output to display a number of reviews (I was thinking of on or two for every website, but can be adjusted) from both websites. As of now I believe simply printing the output in a pretty way is sufficient. In the future I can still decide to write the review information to a file, which should be easy enough to implement quickly.

- Processing
	Both LibraryThing and Goodreads offer an API that I can utilize to get the required data.I can get it by making a request for the input string and then storing the matched response in a dictionary.
	The response would most likely be in XML format, but can be converted to JSON.
	This response can then be iterated over/read through to find the review information. The program would also include a filter for reviews that are too long and too short or too long (ideally the reviews would have a length of approximately one  length paragraph of reasonable length).
	Select the reviews to display (optional/not sure yet: favour reviews with higher ratings, data which can also be requested using the APIs)
