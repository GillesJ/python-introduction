Nobel Prize winner Ishiguro’s success within the prefecture 
On the sixth of October, one after the Japan-born writer with English nationality Kazuo Ishiguro (62) had won the Nobel Prize in Literature, Ishiguro’s books were sold out in bookstores across the prefecture, and the sudden reaction was so great that libraries are being flooded with reservations for his books.

The prefectural library of Tokushima City quickly set up a special corner which includes among others magazines and publications that contain written interviews with Ishiguro, and a collection of works relating to the books that he authored. Because all of Ishiguro’s works are lended out, there are more than 10 pending reservations for his signature work, “The Remains of the Day”. The person in charge said: “His beautiful descriptions are fascinating. I want a lot of people to read it.”

Jun Itami (59), a company employee from Naruto City who got his/her hands on the book in question, said: “I first learned about him as being the winner of the Nobel Prize. Ever since then, my reading pleasure has kept increasing.”

About 10 books of the nobel prize winner were piled up in front of the register in the Tokushima bookshop of the Kinokuniya Store in Tokushima City, yet they were all sold out before midday. The store owner, mister Osawa Koumoto, happily shared: “I was surprised by the unpredictable reaction. I urgently need to refill my supply.”
