Dear Pythonistas,

Given the technical complexity of several projects, we would like to ask you to give a short live presentation of your project. This entails a live demonstration of the working program and a quick run-through of the source code.

This gives you the chance to comment and defend your code, highlight difficulties, and go in discussion.
It also reduces the chance of technical issues with dependencies or platforms.

You will not have to prepare a presentation or anything else. You only have to make sure that:
- The source code is submitted to Minerva.
- Your program runs on the computer/laptop you will use in the demo.
- You are familiar enough with the source code to answer some questions.

We propose two dates for giving the demo:
1. Friday 26th of January 2018: 15:00-18:00h
2. Monday 29th of January 2019: 10:00-12:00h

Please go the [Minerva Forum](http://minerva.ugent.be/main/forum/viewforum.php?forum=1152781) and let us know your preferred slot (taking into account the reactions of other students). If this comes at an inopportune time, do not hesitate to let us know and we try to work it out.

The location will be announced later.

The project deadline is still the 24th of January and your submission is done by uploading your zipped source code in a Minerva Dropbox.

Included in the source code .zip folder you should have:
- Example data if applicable in a /data subfolder.
- if you installed modules with conda or pip:

     Run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in the Anaconda Prompt/terminal (with your project virtualenv active) to get a list of used modules.
     Place that file in the zip.
- A file with the project proposal (.txt, .pdf, .docx, .md, .html).
- A short usage manual file (.txt, .pdf, .docx, .md, .html).
   - Describe which script does what, (you should be able to copy-paste this from the opening comment of each script.) e.g. `main.py: this script runs the full program; count.py: counts the elements of a collection.`
   - How do you run the full program: `To run use "python main.py"`
   - What are the options and how do you set them (if applicable).
- Name the .zip file `FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME(for every person in the group)_PROJECTTITLE_finalproject2018.zip`

Best of luck with your exams,

P. Goethals and G. Jacobs
