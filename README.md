# Course preparation
In the course we will be using software that works best with Google Chrome. Firefox 6 (or above) and Safari will also work. Internet Explorer is not supported. All recommended software is cross-platform and works on Windows, OSX, and Linux. Please, make sure that the software described below is installed and working before coming to the first class.

We will be using Python 3 for our course, which is the latest version. Lower versions are more or less supported, but not recommended.

## Text editor
We advice you to install a good text editor, Sublime Text 3 for example. However, you are absolutely free to use your own favorite editor. For Sublime Text 3 go to http://www.sublimetext.com/, download the version for your operating system, and install.

## Anaconda Python distribution
**We strongly advice you to install the Anaconda Python Distribution.** This distribution contains all the necessary modules and packages needed for this course. It is available for all platforms and provides a simple installation procedure. Be sure to choose the **3.6 version** of the distribution for your specific OS.

You can download it from: http://continuum.io/downloads
(More detailed installation instructions can be found here: http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html)

## Jupyter notebooks
In this course we will be using Jupyter notebooks as a teaching tool. These are files that contain text, markup and executable code meant to make presenting code easy. Jupyter is the program that reads these files and presents them to your web-browser. It comes with the Anaconda distribution. 

Run Jupyter:
- Windows: Use the Anaconda launcher. There should be a shortcut in your menu with Anaconda and/or Jupyter Notebook like any other installed program.
- OSX: Use the Anaconda launcher.
- Linux: Use the Anaconda launcher or in terminal type: jupyter notebook

In case of issues, you can always install Jupyter separately with pip from Anaconda: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
